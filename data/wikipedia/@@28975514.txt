In his diploma application exam ( ) , in 1953 , Jorge Chaves obtained a significant passing grade : 19 out of 20. # Career # His professional career started during the period of 1943-1956 ; a period which Nuno Portas has designated as the stage of resistance in Portuguese architecture and art . From 1944 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborated with architect Joaquim Ferreira . During this period , he also collaborated , occasionally , with architects Filipe Nobre de Figueiredo and Alberto Soeiro . In 1946 he set up his first office together with his graduation classmate Lus Coelho Borges . He was a member of ' ' ICAT - Iniciativas Culturais Arte e Tcnica ' ' ( ) and also of the ' ' Sociedade Nacional de Belas-Artes ' ' ( ) . He participated in four sessions of the ' ' EGAP Exposies Gerais de Artes Plsticas ' ' ( ) by presenting architectural projects . In 1948 , he participated in the ' ' 1 Congresso Nacional de Arquitectura ' ' ( ) . : One of his post - 48 Congress projects was the Laboratorios Cannobio building , designed in 1948 and built in 1949 . This was one of the first buildings to emerge in the Centre of Lisbon displaying an architectural language clearly engaged with the Modern Movement . : His project for the street corner of Rua Braancamp 7 with Rua Mouzinho da Silveira would also have been so , had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipality of Lisbon . In parallel with project activity in his own office , he collaborated with the office of architect Miguel Jacobetty Rosa , between 1948 and 1952 , and did an internship under the direction of architect Hernni Gandra during 1951 . In 1952 he was invited to the office of the architect Porfrio Pardal Monteiro , with whom he worked in designing the Palcio da Rotunda and Sorel buildings , but especially the Hotel Ritz in Lisbon , a remarkable work , for its aesthetic wisdom and excellence of material execution . During architect Porfrio Pardal Monteiro illness and after his death in 1957 , he ensured the continuity of the project of the hotel , by giving assistance to the construction and by heading the phase of execution in a special office built in the site , until its inauguration in 1959 . Although the design of Hotel Ritz was his core activity from 1952 to 1959 , he kept his own office to which he was exclusively dedicated after 1959 . : His most significant architectural production took place during a period caracterized as of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern architecture . During the 1960s , he developed a specific trait , recognizable in such works as the Pastelaria Mexicana in Lisbon or the Hotel Garbe and the Hotel Baleeira in the Algarve and also in housing in Olivais Sul , Rua da Penha de Frana and Rua da Ilha do Prncipe in Lisbon . This latter case has been referred to as perhaps the best urban intervention for housing in Lisbon in that decade . : The Chamber of Commerce of Bissau ( ) , the headquarters of the Guineas Trade , Industry and Agriculture Association ( ) , is considered the most qualified architectural achievement in Bissau during the colonial period . : At the end of the 1950s he produced the remarkable work of Caixa Geral de Depsitos bank in So Pedro do Sul , clearly influenced by the survey on vernacular architecture in Portugal ( ) that was carried out in the late 1950s . : The Pastelaria Mexicana ( a Lisbon cafe and snack-bar ) is a highly remarkable example that led to the limits , in that period and in Portugal , the expressionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century and that developed a phenomenological sense of architectural vision that reached a climax , deemed even exceptional , in the history of architecture in Portugal . : Broken line profiles and non-straight angles , key elements of an international lineage organicism rediscovered in the 1960s , are brilliantly integrated in this perfect example of total design . The process of its classification as a monument of public interest has been ongoing in IGESPAR since 1996 , after an intervention , in that same year , that changed significantly some parts of its architecture . It retains , however , part of the elements that motivated , in 1993 , such a proposed classification . Several of his major works , such as the Pastelaria Mexicana ( cafe ) , the Palissi Galvani shop and the Hotel Florida in Lisbon , the Hotel Garbe , the Hotel da Baleeira and the Hotel Globo in the Algarve or the Chamber of Commerce of Bissau in Guinea-Bissau include conceptually integrated visual arts interventions , some created by himself .
