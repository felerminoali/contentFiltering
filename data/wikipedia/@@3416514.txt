William Basse ( c.15831653 ? ) was an English poet . A follower of Edmund Spenser , he is now remembered principally for an elegy on Shakespeare . He is also noted for his Angler 's song , which was written for Izaak Walton , who included it in ' ' The Compleat Angler ' ' . # Family-background # William Basse 's family background and place of birth are unknown . He was described by the antiquary Anthony Wood in 1638 as of Moreton , near Thame , in Oxfordshire , sometime a retainer to the Lord Wenman of Thame Park . R. Warwick Bond has suggested that Basse may have come to Thame from Northamptonshire as page to Agnes Fermor , first wife of Richard Wenman , 1st Viscount Wenman , and daughter of Sir George Fermor of Easton Neston , Northamptonshire . From the references made in Basse 's poems to Francis Norris , 1st Earl of Berkshire , it has been inferred that the poet was at one time also attached to his household at Rycote , Oxfordshire . Basse dedicated ' ' Polyhymnia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of Montagu Bertie , 2nd Earl of Lindsey , and the opening poem in the volume is addressed to the Countess 's grandfather , Francis Norris , 1st Earl of Berkshire : ' ' In playne ( my honour 'd Lord ) I was not borne ' ' Audacious vowes or forraigne legs to use ; ' ' Nature denyed my outside to adorne , ' ' And I of art to learne outsides refuse . ' ' Yet haveing of them both enough to scorne ' ' Silence and vulgar prayse , this humble Muse ' ' And her meane favourite at your command ' ' Chose in this kinde to kisse your noble hand . # Career # Basse was educated at Lord Williams 's School . The long interval of fifty-one years between the production of the first and last poems bearing Basse 's signature led John Payne Collier to conjecture that there were two poets of the same name , and he attributed to an elder William Basse the works published in 1602 , and to a younger William Basse all those published later . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support this conclusion . Urania , the last poem of the collection , bearing the date 1653 , has all the metrical characteristics of the Sword and Buckler of 1602 ; and Bathurst 's verses prove that Basse followed his poetical career through many generations . A William Basse ' of Suffolk ' entered Emmanuel College , Cambridge , as a sizar in 1629 , and took the degree of B.A. in 1632 , and that of M.A. in 1636 , but it is highly improbable that this student was the poet . There was a family named Basse , of Benhall , Suffolk , in the seventeenth century , of whom a William died in 1607 , aged 85 , and left a son Thomas and a grandson William , probably the Cambridge student ; but it is impossible to identify the poet with any member of this family . The fact that his ' Great Brittaines Sunnesset ' was published at Oxford , and his intimate relations with two great Oxfordshire houses , seem to connect the poet with Oxfordshire rather than with Suffolk . # Verse # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; margin-right : 1em ; font-size : 90% ; background : #c6dbf7 ; color:black ; width:36em ; max-width : 35% ; cellspacing= 5 On Shakespeare  Renowned Spenser , lie a thought more nigh To learned Chaucer , and rare Beaumond lie A little nearer Spenser , to make room For Shakespeare in your threefold , fourfold Tomb .

In 1602 two poems by ' William Bas ' were published in London . The one was entitled Sword and Buckler , or Serving Man 's Defence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Muridella . Of the former , which the author describes as his first production , a unique perfect copy is in the Bodleian Library ; it was reprinted in J. P. Collier 's ' ' Illustrations of Early English Popular Literature ' ' , vol. ii. , in 1864 . The only copy known of the latter is in Winchester College library . In 1613 an elegy on Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , called Great Brittaines ; Sunnes-set , bewailed with a Shower of Teares , by William Basse , was issued by Joseph Barnes at Oxford . It was dedicated by the author to his honourable master , Sir Richard Wenman , knight , and was reproduced at Oxford by W. H. Allnutt from the perfect copy at the Bodleian in 1872 . No other volume of Basse 's poems was printed in his lifetime , but two manuscript collections , prepared for the press , are still extant . Of these one bears the title of ' ' Polyhymnia ' ' , and has never been printed . The only copy of it now known belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fly-leaf is the autograph of Francis , Lord Norreys , to whom the opening verses are addressed , and to whose sister , Bridget , countess of Lindsey , the collection is dedicated . Another manuscript of ' ' Polyhymnia ' ' , described by Cole in his manuscript ' Athen Cantab . ' and now lost , differed materially from the Corser manuscript . The second collection left by Basse in manuscript consists of three long pastoral poems , of which the first is dedicated to Sir Richard Wenman ; bears the date 1653 , and was printed for the first time in J. P. Collier 's ' ' Miscellaneous Tracts ' ' , in 1872 . To it is prefixed a poem addressed to Basse , by Ralph ( afterwards dean ) Bathurst , who compares the author to an aged oak , and says : ' ' # . . . thy grey muse grew up with older times , ' ' ' ' And our deceased grandsires lisp 'd the rhymes . # ' ' Bathurst 's verses were printed in Warton 's pleasant ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the inscription ' To Mr. W. Basse upon the intended publication of his poems , 13 January 1651 . ' According to David Kathman , Basse 's most famous occasional poem is his enormously popular sixteen-line elegy on Shakespeare : # It was written between 1616 ( when Shakespeare died ) and 1623 ( when Jonson responded to Basse in his own tribute to Shakespeare in the ' ' First Folio ' ' ) . Wells and Taylor list twenty-seven different seventeenth-century manuscript versions of the poem , ten of which attribute it to Basse , including one ( British Library , Lansdowne MS 777 , fol. 67v ) in the handwriting of Basse 's friend William Browne . It first reached print in the 1633 edition of John Donne 's poems , but was dropped from the 1635 edition , and was next printed in the 1640 edition of Shakespeare 's poems , with a correct attribution to ' W. B. ' and the title ' On the Death of William Shakespeare , who Died in Aprill , Anno . Dom . 1616 ' ( sig .

B. ' who contributed verses to Phillip Massinger 's ' ' Bondman ' ' ( 1624 ) , although William Browne has also been claimed as their author . In Izaak Walton 's ' ' Compleat Angler ' ' the character Piscator , representing Walton , remarks , I 'll promise you I 'll sing a song that was lately made at my request by Mr. William Basse , one that hath made the choice songs of the ' Hunter in his Career ' and of ' Tom of Bedlam ' , and many others of note ; and this that I will sing is in praise of Angling . Basse 's Angler 's Song , beginning As inward love breeds outward talk , then follows . Piscator 's friend Coridon says we are all beholding to the good man that made this song and proposes a toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Walton , a unique copy of Maister Basse , his careere , or the new hunting . To a new Court tune , is in the Pepys collection at Cambridge ; it is reprinted in ' Wit and Drollery ' ( 1682 ) , p. 64 , and in ' ' Old Ballads ' ' ( 1725 ) , ii . 196 . The tune is given in the Skene MS. preserved in the Advocates ' Library , Edinburgh , and a ballad in the Bagford collection in the British Museum , entitled Hubert 's Ghost , is written to the tune of Basse 's Career . Basse 's second ballad , Tom of Bedlam , has been identified by Sir Harris Nicolas in his edition of Walton 's ' ' Angler ' ' , with a song of the same name in Percy 's ' ' Reliques ' ' , ii . 357 ; but many other ballads bear the same title , and this identification is therefore doubtful . In 1636 Basse contributed a poem to the ' Annalia Dubrensia.
