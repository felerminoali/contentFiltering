Intimate partner violence is domestic violence against a spouse or other intimate partner . The most extreme type of violence is intimate terrorism where one person is violent and controlling , generally perpetrated by men against women and most likely of the types of violence to require medical services and shelter . Survivors of intimate terrorism may engage in violence resistance as the result of the violence . It is likely to be infrequent and be conducted by women . The most common form of intimate partner violence is situational couple violence which is conducted by individuals of both genders , nearly equally . When both partners of a couple engage in controlling and violent behavior it is called mutual violent control . # Background # Intimate partner violence occurs between two people in an intimate relationship . It may occur between heterosexual or homosexual couples and victims are men and women . Couples may be dating , cohabiting or married and violence can occur in or outside of the home . Studies by the 1990s showed that both men and women could be abusers or victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in retaliation or self-defense one time and with less violence than that by men ; Men are more likely to commit long-term cycles of abuse . As a result , the issue is not solely about violence against women , but about violent people or violent couples . It also led to further research to better understand the situations within violent homes . The World Health Organization reported in 2013 that the incidence of women who had experienced physical or sexual abuse from an intimate partner in their lifetime was : # Reciprocal and non-reciprocal # The United States Centers for Disease Control , divide domestic violence into two types : reciprocal , in which both partners are violent , and non-reciprocal violence , in which one partner is violent . # Types # Michael P. Johnson argues for four major types of intimate partner violence , which is supported by subsequent research and evaluation , as well as independent researchers . Distinctions are made among the types of violence , motives of perpetrators , and the social and cultural context based upon patterns across numerous incidents and motives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intimate terrorism # Intimate terrorism ( IT ) occurs when one partner in a relationship uses coercive control and power over the other partner , using threats , intimidation , and isolation . In such cases , one partner , usually a man , controls virtually every aspect of the victim 's , usually a woman 's , life . Michael P. Johnson reported in 2001 that 97% of the perpetrators of intimate terrorism were men . It may involve sexual , sadistic control , economic , physcial , emotional and psychological abuse . Intimate terrorism is more likely to escalate over time , not as likely to be mutual , and more likely to involve serious injury . Because this type of violence is most likely to be extreme , it is survivors of intimate terrorism that are most likely to require medical services and the safety of shelters . Abusers are more likely to have witnessed abuse as children than those who engage in situational couple violence . IT batterers include two types : **28;77176;TOOLONG and dysphoric-borderline . The first type includes people with general psychopathic and violent tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the relationship . Violence by a person against their intimate partner is often done as a way for controlling their partner , even if this kind of violence is not the most frequent . Support for this typology has been found in subsequent evaluations. # Violent resistance # Violent resistance ( VR ) , sometimes thought of as self-defense , is violence perpetrated by victims against their partners who have exerted intimate terrorism against them . Within relationships of intimate terrorism and violent resistance , 96% of the violent resisters are women . # Situational couple violence # Situational couple violence ( SCV ) , also called common couple violence ( CCV ) , is not connected to general control behavior , but arises in a single argument where one or both partners physically lash out at the other . This is the most common form of intimate partner violence , particularly in the western world and among young couples , and involves members of both sexes nearly equally . Among college students , Johnson found it to be perpetrated about 44% of the time by women and 56% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which conflict occasionally gets out of hand , leading usually to minor forms of violence , and rarely escalates into serious or life-threatening forms of violence . In situational couple violence , acts of violence by men and women occur at fairly equal rates , with rare occurrences of injury , and are not committed in an attempt to control a partner . It is estimated that approximately 50% of couples experience SCV in their relationships . # #Characteristics# # Situational couple violence is characterized by a few main traits : * Mode : Mildly aggressive behavior such as throwing objects , ranging to more aggressive behaviors such as pushing , slapping , biting , hitting , scratching , or hair pulling . * Frequency:Less frequent than PT , occurring once in a while during an argument or disagreement . * Severity : Milder than PT , very rarely escalates to more severe abuse , generally does not include injuries that were serious or that caused one partner to be admitted to a hospital . * Mutuality:Violence may be equally expressed by either partner in the relationship . * Intent:Occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gaining control and power over the other partner . # #Further research# # In 2004 , Graham-Kevan &amp; Archer were able to partly replicate Johnson 's hypothesis . However , they identified three subtypes of domestic violence rather than Johnson 's two : CCV ; what they termed intimate terrorism , ( IT ) noting that women and men can both use violence to control non-violent mates ; and mutual violent control where both partners use IT-levels of violence . However , Graham-Kevan &amp; Archer also stressed that their and Johnson 's research sampling methods should be regarded as preliminary : their subjects were relatively few in number and were drawn from known crime victims or battered women , and thus may not be representative of randomized general population samples . Moreover , Graham-Kevan &amp; Archer argued that , by relying entirely on analysis of data from one partner in an abusive relationship , Johnson 's study was incomplete and skewed due to reporting bias . In 1998 , Milardo reported that women are more likely to initiate CCV in common dating scenarios ( 83% of female subjects were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to 53% of men ) . Furthermore , men reported higher rates of fearing they would suffer CCV ( 70% of men vs. 50% of women ) . When questioned about the use of more serious violence analogous to Patriarchal or Intimate Terrorism , Milardo found that women were again more likely to approve of its use against a partner . However , women had higher rates of fearing they would be seriously battered . # Mutual violent control # Mutual violent control ( MVC ) is rare type of intimate partner violence occurring when both partners act in a violent manner , battling for control . # Sexual violence # Sexual violence by intimate partners varies by country and can reach as high as 25% of the women having been subject to forced sex . In some countries forced sex , or marital rape , often occurs with other forms of domestic violence , particularly physical abuse . # Notes #
