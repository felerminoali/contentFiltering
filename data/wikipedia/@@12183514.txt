' ' The ripon barbel ( ' ' Barbus altianalis ' ' ) is an East African ray-finned fish species in the family Cyprinidae . A huge barb , its maximum recorded total length is 90cm in.Ntakimazi ( 2006 ) # Taxonomy # Like other African barbs , placement of this species in ' ' Barbus ' ' &amp;ndash ; the genus of the typical barbels and relatives &amp;ndash ; is provisional . Though called barbel , it is probably not closely enough related to the typical barbels &amp;ndash ; the core group of ' ' Barbus ' ' &amp;ndash ; to be considered congeneric . Several supposedly distinct species have been merged into ' ' B. altianalis ' ' , and numerous subspecies have been proposed . None of these are deemed valid nowadays , at least until a thorough restudy of the species . On the other hand , ' ' B. longifilis ' ' , ' ' B. paucisquamatus ' ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' ' B : altianalis ' ' , the second as sspp. ' ' lobogenysoides ' ' and ' ' paucisquamata ' ' and the third as ssp. ' ' urundensis ' ' .

The Ripon Barbel does not occur there , and the taxon was thus thought to refer to ' ' Labeobarbus intermedius ' ' . But the Amala is actually a tributary of the Mara River , where ' ' B. altianalis ' ' is found , and ' ' B. procatopus ' ' is thus a junior synonym of it . # Distribution and ecology # The Ripon Barbel inhabits Lake Victoria and its drainage basin and surrounding areas in the East African Rift , including Lake Edward , George , Kyoga and Kivu , and the Ruzizi River down to its delta ( though not adjacent Lake Tanganyika ) and the upper and middle Kagera River . Records from the Tana River are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Burundi , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Kenya , Rwanda , Tanzania and Uganda . It lives in diverse freshwater habitats , from inshore waters of lakes to rapidly flowing rivers . This species is an omnivore , eating water plants , molluscs and fishes . It is fished for sport and food ; its Kagera River population being of some commercial significance . Widespread and apparently rather plentiful for such a large fish due to its ecological tolerance and omnivorous habits , the Ripon Barbel is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN . Local stocks might be temporarily affected by erosion after deforestation increasing turbidity and upsetting the aquatic plant life , and unsustainable growth of the fisheries e.g. along the Kagera must be avoided considering that it is presumably &amp;ndash ; as per its large size and like many relatives &amp;ndash ; slow-growing and takes long to mature . # Footnotes #
