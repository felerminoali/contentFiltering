The Australian 34th Brigade was an Australian Army brigade . The brigade was formed in late 1945 following the end of World War II as part of the Australian contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . In late 1948 it was renamed the 1st Brigade . # History # During the final part of World War II the Australian government became concerned that despite the nation 's contributions to the Allied war effort , that these might not be recognised in the post war settlement . As a result shortly after Japan 's capitulation , the Australian prime minister , Ben Chifley made a formal offer of troops for occupation duty . The Australian contribution was to encompass naval , air and ground forces , the later of which were to form an independent brigade-sized formation . As the process of demobilising Australia 's military forces had begun the day the war ended , it was necessary to raise a new force and consequently the 34th Brigade was formed on 27 October 1945 at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies .

After a lengthy period of training which took place while political negotiations between the Allied powers took place , the brigade finally departed for Japan in February 1946 , arriving at Kure between the 21 and 23 February . With an authorised strength of 4,700 personnel , the brigade was structured around three infantry battalionsthe 65th , 66th and 67thwith various supporting arms including an artillery battery , a squadron of engineers and an armoured car squadron , which had been raised from the 4th Armoured Brigade and equipped with Staghound armoured cars . The Australian contribution represented about one third of the strength of the BCOF force , while the other two-thirds were provided by India , the United Kingdom and New Zealand . As part of the BCOF , the 34th Brigade was assigned responsibility for providing security and enforcing the armistice conditions in Hiroshima Prefecture . The 65th Battalion was based at Fukuyama , the 66th Battalion at Hiro and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupation , however , the brigade 's units conducted regular patrols throughout the prefecture and provided support to the occupation government . During this time , the tasks that the 34th Brigade were involved in included providing security for elections , locating and destroying war equipment and stores , and ceremonial duties , including mounting guard at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo . As a result of the withdrawal of British and Indian forces throughout 1947 , the brigade had to expand the area in which it operated at that time . By June of that year , the Australians made up the bulk of the BCOF , representing 6,250 personnel out of the total force of 6,850 . In October the New Zealanders also withdrew , and shortly thereafter , as a result of the stable security situation in Japan , the Australian government decided to reduce its contribution to the Allied occupation force from a full brigade , to just one infantry battalion , as well as one fighter squadron and supporting personnel in an effort to build up the newly established Australian Regular Army .
