# Summary # A refinery owned by Gulf Oil Corporation in Philadelphia , located at Girard Point on the Schuylkill River in South Philadelphia , caught fire on August 17 , 1975 . This incident resulted in the death of eight firefighters of the Philadelphia Fire Department , injuries to 14 other firefighters , and the loss of a Philadelphia fire apparatus . At the height of this fire , the loss of the huge , sprawling refinery complex was regarded as a real possibility as a tremendous firestorm enveloped two storage tanks , piping , and the refinerys administration building . # Before the fire # The refinery , built in 1905 , occupied 723 acre of land located on the east bank of the Schuylkill River at Penrose Avenue . The Penrose Avenue Bridge ( now the George Platt Memorial Bridge ) connects the east and west sides of the Schuylkill River and passes directly over the refinery . At the time of this fire , the refinery produced 180000 oilbbl per day of refined petroleum products . Prior to August 17 , 1975 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 , eight of which had occurred since 1966 . On September 9 , 1960 , several storage tanks were struck by lightning at the height of severe thunderstorms and resulted in an eight-alarm fire . On May 16 , 1975 , a six-alarm fire struck the Gulf Refinery . Subsequently , a second six-alarm fire occurred on October 20 , 1975 . At 12:45 a.m. on the morning of Sunday , August 17 , 1975 , the tanker ' ' M/T Afran Neptune ' ' , tied up at a Gulf Refinery dock , began pumping reconstituted Venezulan crude oil ( with an additional 5 percent naphtha ) into Gulf Refinery Tank No. 231 . Tank No. 231 , built in 1929 , of riveted seam construction , had a capacity of 75000 oilbbl and had recently been renovated with an internal floating roof . Within the refinery , the tank was located at Avenue Y and 4th Street . Avenue Y is an east-west street running parallel to and just to the north of the Penrose Avenue Bridge , while 4th Street is a north-south street running perpendicular to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tank No. 231 was Boiler House No. 4 , the site of a four-alarm fire on April 22 , 1967 . A brick chimney arose from Boiler House No. 4 and this stack was a familiar sight to westbound motorists on the Penrose Avenue Bridge as the word GULF was painted in large , white letters . # The fire # Hydrocarbon vapors , emanating from Tank 231 , accumulated in the area of the boiler house and were ignited by an unknown ignition source . A flame front followed the vapors back to Tank 231 , causing fire at the tanks vents and an explosion within the outer shell of the stack . These events began to unfold at 5:57 a.m . Shortly thereafter , a second explosion occurred within Tank 231 . Burning petroleum spilled from the tanks vents into a diked area surrounding the tank . Within the diked area , a second tank ( No. 114 ) just north of Tank 231 , containing No. 6 grade fuel oil , also ignited as pipelines within the diked area began to fail . The initial explosion also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petroleum pouring out under pressure ignited . # 2nd alarm # At 6:04 a.m. , upon receiving the report of fire from the Gulf Refinery , the Philadelphia Fire Department transmitted the refinerys fire alarm box : Box 5988 , Penrose and Lanier Avenues . Upon leaving their station , Engine 60 ( the assigned first-due engine company ) could see fire and smoke conditions at a distance , and before arriving at the refinery , Engine 60 ordered the second alarm at 6:09 a.m. # 5th alarm # First arriving companies had large clouds of heavy black smoke emanating from Tank No. 231 , fire on top of Tank No.114 , and fire showing from the 150ft m stack at Boiler House No.4 . The third and fourth alarms were ordered in quick succession by Battalion Chief 1 , Arthur Foley , at 6:11 a.m. and 6:14 am . Acting Assistant Fire Chief Dalmon Edmunds ordered the fifth alarm at 6:34 am . The sixth alarm was ordered by Fire Commissioner Joseph Rizzo at 6:52 am . Over the next several hours , firefighters utilized deluge guns and master streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the burning tanks and piping in an effort to extinguish the fire . By 8:44 a.m. , it appeared that the fire was well contained and the situation sufficiently stabilized to declare the fire under control . Commissioner Rizzo remained on the firegrounds throughout the warm , muggy August day to continue to oversee the fire-fighting operation . Philadelphias two foam pumpers , Engines 160 and 133 , along with the Gulf Refinerys foam pumper , continued to apply foam to the burning tank , piping and manifolds . Additional foam was acquired throughout the day from the fire departments warehouse and the nearby Atlantic-Richfield refinery . It was also obtained from the National Foam Company in West Chester , Pennsylvania . However , as the firefighting operation progressed , it became apparent that the refinerys sewage system was not up to the task of properly draining the foam , water and petroleum-naphtha product mixture that was accumulating on the ground along Avenue Y , between 4th Street and 5th Street to the east , running in front of the refinerys administration building . These drainage problems were further exacerbated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps . These pumps were shut off as part of a decision to de-energize overhead power lines that ran adjacent to Tank 231 along 4th Street . As the liquid mixture continued to build up in Avenue Y , Engines 16 and 40 were sent to Avenue Y and 5th Street to draft from a sewer intake and pump the material to a diked area some distance away . # Additional Ignition # Engine 133 was set up on the east side of Tank No. 231 at Avenue Y at 4th Street , applying foam to the tank . Three members were attending to the apparatus and wading in the foam-water-petroleum mixture which was accumulating on the ground . Commissioner Rizzo and Gulf Refinery manager Jack Burk were on an overhead catwalk nearby observing the fire-fighting operation . Without warning , and in full view of Commissioner Rizzo and Burk , the accumulating liquid surrounding Engine 133 ignited , immediately trapping the three firefighters working at Engine 133 . Instinctively and without hesitation , other nearby firefighters dove into the burning liquid to rescue their comrades , not aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the advancing fire . # 9th alarm # It was now 4:41 p.m. and a firestorm was developing as the fire quickly spread eastward along Avenue Y towards 5th Street . Viewing the unfolding horror before him , Commissioner Rizzo ordered two more alarms , five additional rescue squads , and the recall of all companies which had previously been released from the firegrounds throughout the day . On these orders , the fire alarm room transmitted the seventh and eighth alarms . As the fire had been placed under control nearly eight hours earlier , firefighters in stations across the city knew that the unthinkable had occurred as these additional alarms were struck . At 4:46 p.m. , Commissioner Rizzo ordered the ninth alarm and notification of Philadelphia Managing Director Hillel Levinson as a major disaster was now unfolding at the Gulf Refinery . As the fire swept eastward along 5th Street , Philadelphias foam pumpers , Engines 160 and 133 , and the Gulf Refinery foam pumper were destroyed in the fires advance . At 5th Street , where Engines 16 and 40 had been assigned to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , although their pump operators were able to escape . Upon reaching 5th Street , the fire traveled two city blocks north along 5th Street , threatening four additional storage tanks and the 125ft m Penrose Avenue Bridge . # 10th alarm # At 5:37 p.m. , Commissioner Rizzo ordered the tenth alarm as the fire was then traveling southward and engulfing the refinerys administration building , which was located on the south side of Avenue Y between 4th and 5th Streets . The tenth alarm companies were ordered to report to Gate 24 at Penrose and Lanier Avenues , to set up deluge guns and leave the area . As the tenth alarm was being requested , a box alarm was being transmitted for a fire in a paper warehouse 15 mi away at F Street and Erie Avenue . Upon arrival , Chief Edward Hampson , Battalion Chief 10 , had heavy fire in a three-story , former printing company now being used for paper storage . The second alarm was ordered at 6:07 p.m. , followed by a special call for three additional engine companies at 7:18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at the New Jersey shore , returned to the City and assumed command of operations . # 11th alarm # As the situation continued to deteriorate at the Gulf Refinery , Commissioner Rizzo ordered all of the D platoon members from the day shift held over , and at 6:01 p.m. , he ordered the 11th alarm . By seven oclock , the involved tanks and pipelines were gushing flames and nearby streets in the complex were burning streams of oil and other petroleum products . For a period of time , it was far from certain where the fire would be stopped . Burk was quoted as saying that contingency plans had been made for a retreat through the refinery , street by street , tank by tank . But far from retreating , the men of the Philadelphia Fire Department attacked , retaking 5th Street , 4th Street , and finally Avenue Y. At 1:00 a.m. , Commissioner Rizzo left the firegrounds , relinquishing command to Deputy Fire Commissioner Harry T. Kite , who placed the fire under control at 5:38 a.m. on Monday , August 18 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rizzo went to area hospitals to visit the injured members and went to the homes of the families of the members who were unaccounted . By Monday morning , the true cost of this disaster became apparent . Six firefighters were killed and two were severely burned in the flare-up that occurred on Sunday afternoon . The six firefighters were : * Firefighter John Andrews , Age 49 , Engine 49 * Firefighter Joseph Wiley , Age 33 , Ladder 27 * Firefighter Roger Parker , Age 28 , Ladder 27 * Firefighter Hugh McIntyre , Age 53 , Engine 56 * Firefighter Robert Fisher , Age 43 , Engine 33 * Firefighter Ralph Campana , Age 41 , Ladder 19 Fire Lieutenant James Pouliot , age 35 , Engine 20 , died of his burns on August 24 , 1975 and Firefighter Carroll Brenek , age 33 , of Engine 57 , died of his burns on August 30 , 1975 . Fourteen other firefighters were burned and/or injured in their attempts to rescue the men caught in the flare-up . A second tank , 239 , storing naphtha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located on 4th Street just north of Avenue Y. On Monday morning , naphtha was pouring out of a # Fire Out # A decision was made to allow the fire in the original tank , Tank 231 , to burn itself out , and the fire was declared extinguished on Tuesday , August 26 , 1975 . However , in the intervening week , box alarms were transmitted for flare-ups on four different occasions to assist the fireground details that continued to work on the fire . # Cause of fire # The original cause of the fire was the overfilling of Tank 231 . While no crude oil escaped from the tank as a result of being overfilled , large quantities of hydrocarbon vapors were trapped above the surface of the tanks crude oil . As the quantity of crude oil increased , these hydrocarbon vapors were forced out of the tanks vents and into the area of the No. 4 Boiler House where the initial flash occurred . The overfilling of the tank , in turn , resulted from a failure of the tankers personnel to properly monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At approximately 6:02 a.m. in the wake of the first explosions and fire , the tanker terminated its pumping operations , left its Schuylkill River berth and relocated to the Gulf piers at Hog Island . In August 2007 , about 200 people gathered at the Firemans Hall Museum in Philadelphia as plaques were unveiled to honor the firefighters lost in the refinery disaster . The refinery has since been acquired by Sunoco.
