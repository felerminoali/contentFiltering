The 2010 FIL World Lacrosse Championship was held between 1524 July 2010 . The premier international men 's lacrosse tournament took place in Manchester , United Kingdom . A record 29 nations ( not including the Iroquois team , which registered but did not compete because of passport issues ) competed at the event , eight more than the 2006 World Lacrosse Championships , which were held in London , Ontario . From its inception in 1967 through the 2006 event , the World Lacrosse Championships were sanctioned by the International Lacrosse Federation ( ILF ) . In 2008 , the ILF merged with the former governing body for women 's lacrosse , the International Federation of Women 's Lacrosse Associations ( IFWLA ) , to form the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) . From the 2010 World Championships , all future World Championships will be sanctioned by FIL .

The team sought to travel on their Haudenosaunee passports , but the British government demanded evidence that the United States would allow the Iroquois to travel and return . Even after the United States Department of State gave the team a one-time waiver , the British government denied entry to the team , saying the Iroquois passports were unacceptable . As a result , the Iroquois would have had to forfeit their opening match against England , with the host team playing Germany in an exhibition match instead . However , FIL decided to move Germany to the Blue Division and the Iroquois to the Plum Division , making the England-Germany match an official one . The Iroquois team did not officially withdraw from the tournament , and would have been allowed to play its remaining games should it have resolved its passport difficulties .

The first and second place teams from the Blue Division advanced to the tournament semifinals . The third and fourth place teams from the Blue had to compete in play-in games ( essentially quarterfinals ) against teams that advanced from the Top Bracket of the lower divisions . The fifth and sixth place teams from the Blue were eliminated from championship contention and instead took part in games to determine their final placement .
