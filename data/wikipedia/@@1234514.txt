Mervue United took a two goal lead before a flood light failure resulted in the game being stopped for 15 minutes . The game was delayed a second time by a stray dog entering the pitch before Kildare County pulled back two goals from Phillip Hughes in the second half resulting in a draw and leaving the affair finely poised for the second leg in Station Road on Friday November the 22nd 2008 . A 3-0 defeat on the night meant that Kildare County lost 5-2 on aggregate potentially relegating the club to the A league should Mervue United decide to take their place in the First Division . # 2009 # Tony Cousins left the club and was succeeded by Kildare County 's Under 21 manager Thomas Donnelly for the 2009 season .

Kildare County could still play in the First Division should another side fail to meet the First Division critera . They were awarded a place in the First Division in place of Cobh Ramblers on February 16 . Kildare County were themselves in financial difficulties and were forced to slash the players wage bill in order to survive . Many players were released including the experienced Paul Donnelly , Thomas Morgan , Austin O'Neil and Colin Fortune . Kildare instead were forced to pick local talent from the KDFL and the team that Donnelly put together consisted mostly of amateurs with only 4 part-time professionals . Many of Donnelly 's preferred signings would n't commit to the team before their First Division status was guaranteed , and by that date it was too late as they had signed contracts with alternative teams . After drawing their first match against Finn Harps they went on a run of 7 straight defeats in the League and exited the EA Sports League Cup at the hands of Shamrock Rovers . Their worst defeat in that spell came against Sporting Fingal who put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home crowd at Station Road . The final straw for the man in charge came in Century Homes Park after a 5-1 drubbing to Monaghan who were also winless and only on 1 point before that match . Thomas Donnelly and Kildare County parted company . Kildare had lost 8 and drawn 1 , conceded 34 goals and scored 3 , went through a barren spell of 651 minutes without scoring a single goal , and also recorded their record defeat at home to Sporting Fingal under Thomas Donnelly 's reign . Joe Somerville was appointed as the new manager in April 2009 . The club won their first match in 8 months defeating Mervue 4-1 . The club ended its association with O'Neills shortly after Sommerville took charge and the team kit is now provided by adidas . The Thoroughbreds also had mid season friendlies against Leyton Orient , Dundee United , Newry City F.C . and a Sunderland XI . Kildare 's final game of the season was at home against Shelbourne . Before the game , the management team and board resigned from the club . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure the fixture was fulfilled - with Kildare playing in a makeshift kit and match-day operations being run by fans . Kildare County FC lost the game 5-1 - their last ever goal being scored by local player Trevor Bowers . After the game , the club was wound up and disbanded . # Fans # The Kildare County official supporters club was founded at around the same time as the club 's foundation .

The Kildare County Supporters Club logo designed and created by Founding member and first club Chairman Eugene Donovan with creative input from Derek Meade In the 2006 season the Supporters club introduced their new mascot to the world of Eircom League football- Stevie Capaill . The mascot is extremely popular with the young supporters of Kildare County and appears during the half time mini-matches which the supporters club play a role in organising . The matches involve young under-age soccer sides from the Kildare district and are enjoyed by both supporters and the participating young players . Since 2006 many of Kildare County 's games were recorded by a pair of fans and the highlights can be viewed on the website YouTube . The fans , Christopher and David Heaney were awarded the Thoroughbred achievement award at the end of the 2007 season . In 2007 a group of young supporters set up a bebo site . The supporters club organised buses for a group of young fans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kildare county fixtures against Kilkenny City and Shelbourne . A small group of young fans had decided that Station Road had become too quiet for a soccer game and that they would start to make some noise during the Shelbourne tie which was also County highest gate of the 2007 season . The group grew from 15 to 30 regular youths as the season progressed . The County Coults have become well known among the Kildare County faithful for their singing and chanting throughout the Kildare County home games at Station Road and were given the honour of presenting some of the Kildare County players with the Supporters Club Player of the Month awards as the 2007 season progressed . Sadly the County Coults numbers declined as the 2008 season progressed and they are now no more .

Jimmy Dowling was responsible for coming up with the idea of the formation of an Eircom League team that all of Kildare could support , Kildare County . Michael Casey Michael Casey was one of those responsible for the formation of Kildare County . He resigned from his position in August 2009 as general manager and director of Kildare County . Casey stated that he has ' always been convinced that there is a place for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked hard on many fronts to ensure the survival of the Club through good times and bad . I still hold the same opinion today ' . His resignation came only two weeks after his daughter Regina also resigned from all her posts at the club . Regina Casey Regina was the club 's financial controller since the club 's formation in 2002 . Regina played a large role in ensuring the club was successful in its yearly application for a First Division Licence . Her father Michael stated he ' was saddened recently to witness the resignation of Regina from all the posts she held within the Club . Regina dedicated an enormous amount of her time and skill to an extensive range of duties on behalf of the Club ' in his own statement of resignation only two weeks after she had resigned . Dermot Keely Was appointed Kildare County 's first manager leading the club to 5th position in their maiden season . Keely had previously been in charge of Shamrock Rovers and Dundalk , Shelbourne amongst others . Quite a lot of well-known managers have served under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longford Town ) , John Gill ( Dundalk ) , Pat Fenlon ( Shelbourne ) , Paul Doolin ( Drogheda United ) and Pat Scully ( Shamrock Rovers ) have all at one time or another served under Dermot Keely . Dermot Keely was in charge of Kildare County until 21 July 2003 when he resigned from the club to take over Premier League outfit Derry City . Keely had been previously in charge of Shelbourne ( 19982002 ) guiding the club to two championships ( 19992000 and 200102 ) and one FAI Cup ( 2000 ) . He also guided Shels to victory over Macedonian side Sloga Jugomagnat in the first round of 2000-01 Champions League qualifiers . Under Keely Kildare County had played 47 games , winning 21 , drawing 12 and were defeated in 14 . Dermot was quoted as saying on his departure from the club that it had nothing to do with Kildare County but that the chance to manage Derry City was too big a chance to turn down . I spent the whole weekend agonising over my decision and finally it came down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donegal and also the chance to manage at the highest level - I have the greatest of respect for all at Kildare County and wish them all the best in the future and I am sure that they will replace me and continue to go from strength to strength I have made a lot of good friends in Kildare and it will the second result that I will be looking for every week . Dermot Keely who had succeeded Kevin Mahon , tenure at Derry city was short however lasting less than a single season . Keely tendered his resignation to the Board of Directors stating that he did n't have what was required to secure the Brandywell club 's position in the top flight following a 2-0 defeat by UCD . Keely had failed to pick up a single victory in the league with the club 's sole win in 12 games arriving in the FAI Cup third round 1-0 replay victory over Cobh Ramblers . He took charge of Dubin City in 2005 leading the club to promotion to the Premier Division before they subsequently folded in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the first time in the history of League of Ireland football that a club had folded mid season due to financial reasons . Dermot Keely blamed the Eircom Leagues move to summer football , Who is going to these summer soccer games on the hottest days of the year ? What crowds are we getting ? All of this has been done to help get some good results in Europe but does that have to come at the cost of losing a club ? and was also quoted as saying that more dark days lie ahead . Keely returned to troubled club Shelbourne as their new manager two weeks before the start of the 2007 season . Gavin Dykes Gavin Dykes is best known for his eight seasons spent with Sligo Rovers . Dykes captained his home town club to an FAI Cup win in 1994 before moving to Derry City , winning a league title in 1997 . Dykes then moved to Donegal based outfit Finn Harps playing there for three seasons and was also for player/manager . Gavin Dykes resigned as player/manager of at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club in which he requested more money to strengthen the squad , but was told that further cutbacks were required . With the club already in real financial difficulty , Dykes resigned as manager and as a player at a time when the club were second from bottom of the Eircom League Premier Division . The club 's situation worsened when the players at the club requested that they be placed on the transfer list . On his arrival to Station Road Gavin Dykes established himself as a fan favourite and can probably lay claim to being the inspiration behind the first chant from the Kildare supporters , We love you Dykesy , cos youve got grey hair , we love you Dykesy , cos your everywhere . Dykes further proved his popularity amongst Kildare supporters when he picked up the first ever Kildare County Supporters Club player of the month in October . A serious back injury led to Dykes retiring from playing in 2003 after almost 400 Eircom League games . He was then installed as assistant manager to Dermot Keely . Gavin Dykes became the new manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dermot Keely . Dykes resigned on 29 May 2004 shaking hands with his players in the dressing room before leavibg Derry City with the club at the time lying two points off the bottom of the eircom Premier Division . It was ironic that Dykes 's reign ended against Drogheda United as Drogheda United were also the opposition that Dykes had faced in his first game in charge . Gavin Dykes was also assistant manager at Newry Town for two years . He holds a UEFA A Licence and is currently manager of Castlebar Celtic and was named Mayo Manager of the Year for 2006 . He managed both the senior team and Castlebar Celtics Eircom League Under 21 team for the 2007/2008 season . He stepped down as manager of both teams before the start of the 2008/2009 season . John Gill John Gill had started out in football as a player at Drogheda United where he spent most of his playing career . He did play for other clubs including Kilkenny City , Bray Wanderers and Sligo Rovers . John Gill 's debut in management was with Dublin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assistant manager at Kilkenny City before taking up the same role alongside Dermot Keely at newly formed Kildare County F.C . in 2002 . His stay at Kildare was short however and he took over Dublin City in 2003 leading the club to the Premier Division . Gill resigned the following season however after a poor start in the league and a subsequent defeat by Division One outfit Monaghan United in the second round of the FAI Cup . Gill did not re-enter football management until the second half of the 2005 season with Athlone Town . He moved to Dundalk the following season leading the club to second in Division One .
