Paean ( foaled 4 April 1983 &amp;ndash ; ca. 1989 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire . A specialist over long distances he was ideally suited by soft ground on which he won the 1987 Ascot Gold Cup by a modern record margin of fifteen lengths . He had previously finished second on his only start as a two-year-old in 1985 and won five times as a three-year-old in 1986 . Paean broke down with an injury after his Gold Cup win and never raced again . In a brief stud career he showed some promise as a sire of steeplechasers. # Background # Paean was a bay horse with a large white star bred and owned by John Scott-Ellis , 9th Baron Howard de Walden a prominent member of the Jockey Club . Other horses to race in Lord Howard de Walden 's apricot colours included Kris , Diesis and Slip Anchor . Paean was one of the best horses sired by Bustino , who 1973 St Leger and the 1974 Coronation Cup as well as finishing second to Grundy in a famous race for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dam Mixed Applause also produced the St James 's Palace Stakes winner Shavian and , as a descendant of the broodmare My Game , was closely related to Marwell , Marling and Unite . Lord Howard de Walden sent his colt into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place Stable in Newmarket , Suffolk . # Racing career # # 1985 : two-year-old season # Paean 's only race as a two-year-old came in a twenty-runner maiden race at Newbury Racecourse in August . He took the lead approaching the final furlong but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a head by Kolgong Heights . Timeform commented that he would stay at least 1 miles and was sure to win a similar contest . # 1986 : three-year-old season # Paean developed into a successful racehorse at three , winning five of his seven races without being tested against top class opposition . He won a maiden race over eleven furlongs at Newbury and won minor races at Newcastle and Pontefract . At Beverley Racecourse in August he was moved up in distance and won a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of the season he faced slightly better opposition in the George Stubbs Stakes over two miles at Newmarket Racecourse on 31 October and won by half a length from Rosedale , a colt who had finished second in the St. Leger Italiano. # 1987 : four-year-old season # Paean began his third season by finishing third in a handicap race over fourteen furlong at Newmarket . He was then moved up in class to contest the Group Three Sagaro Stakes over two miles at Ascot Racecourse in May and finished second , beaten three quarters of a length by Sadeem . Paean returned to Ascot on 18 June for the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles . In the build up to the race , the Cecil stable 's main hope appeared to be Bonhomie , a colt who had finished second in the previous year 's Irish Derby . On the morning of the race however , the stable jockey Steve Cauthen , deciding that Bonhomie would be unsuited by the unusually soft ground , deserted the colt to take the ride on Paean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadeem , with Paean third choice in the betting on 6/1 , having been backed down from 14/1 at the start of the day . Paean took the lead half a mile from the finish and drew clear in the straight to win by fifteen lengths , by far the biggest winning margin in the race since the Second World War . His success was one of seven for Cecil at the four-day meeting . Less than a week after his win at Ascot , Paean sustained a serious tendon injury and was retired from racing . # Assessment # In 1985 the independent Timeform organisation gave Paean a rating of 85p , the p indicating that he was likely to improve . The prediction proved correct as he achieved a rating of 102 in the following year and a peak rating of 123 in 1987 . In the latter year , the official International Classification rated him the second best older stayer in Europe , three pounds behind the Premio Roma winner Orban . In their book ' ' A Century of Champions ' ' , based on a modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris rated Paean as a poor winner of the Gold Cup . # Stud record # After his retirement from racing , Paean was sent to Ireland where he stood as a breeding stallion at the Greenville House Stud at Kilmacow , County Kilkenny . He was marketed as a National Hunt stallion and stood at a fee of IR1,000 a mare . Paean survived only two seasons at stud but sired some good steeplechasers including the Whitbread Gold Cup winner Eulogy. # Pedigree #
