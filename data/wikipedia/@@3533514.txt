* ' ' A. deinosauriscus ' '  Elzanowski &amp; Wellnhofer , 1992 ( type )  ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' is a genus of maniraptoriform theropod dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia . # Discovery and naming # In 1965 , a Polish-Mongolian paleontological expedition found a fossil of a small dinosaur at Bayn Dzak , Mongolia . In 1983 , the find was reported by Andrzej Elzanowski . The remains were named as the type species ' ' Archaeornithoides deinosauriscus ' ' by Elzanowski and Peter Wellnhofer in 1992 . In 1993 , they were described in more detail by the same authors . The generic name ( ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' ) means shaped like an ancient bird in Ancient Greek , from , ' ' archaios ' ' , ancient ; , ' ' ornis ' ' , bird ; and , ' ' eidos ' ' , form . The specific descriptor ' ' deinosauriscus ' ' , little dinosaur , alludes to the animal 's small size for a dinosaur . The holotype , ZPAL MgD-II/29 , was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dating from the late Campanian . It consists of an articulated but fragmentary skull and lower jaws comprehending paired maxillae , a partial jugal , palate bones and dentaries . The specimen represents a juvenile individual . # Description # The holotype of ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' was a very small individual . The head fragment as preserved measures just twenty-seven millimetres in length , indicating an original skull length of about five centimetres . The body length was estimated at fifty to sixty centimetres , making the ' ' Archaiornithoides ' ' type one of the smallest known non-avian dinosaurs . Adult length is uncertain . The snout of ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' features a long antorbital fenestra , stretching over three quarters of the length of the maxilla . The maxilla bears at least eight teeth . These are small , conical and smooth , lacking wrinkles , serrations or carinae . The palatine bone seems to show the presence of a secondary fenestra. # Classification # Elanowski &amp; Wellnhofer ( 1993 ) claimed that ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' was the closest known relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features ; an interdigitated suture between the premaxilla and maxilla , broad palatal shelves , pneumatic sinuses , lack of interdental plates , and unserrated teeth . Since publication , though , all of these features have been discovered in new fossils of adult and/or juvenile troodonts and dromaeosaurs . The describing authors in 1993 also concluded that ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' was closely related to troodontids , Spinosauridae and ' ' Lisboasaurus ' ' , all these taxa together with birds forming a clade , showing that birds originated from a more basal position than normally assumed . However , subsequent research has not supported a close relationship between spinosaurids and troodontids and ' ' Lisboasaurus ' ' was later shown to be a lizard or a crocodylomorph . Some scientists had suggested that the juvenile specimen of ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' may belong to a previously known species of Mongolian troodontid , either ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' or ' ' Byronosaurus ' ' . However , studies of a juvenile ' ' Byronosaurus ' ' skull showed that theropod dinosaurs possess many distinctive adult characteristics even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters solidly linking ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' to known adult specimens shows that it is probably a distinct species . Bever and Norell ( in 2009 ) found no evidence to support the placement of ' ' Archaeornithoides ' ' close to Avialae , and only weak support for the idea that it is a juvenile troodontid. # Possible predation by mammals # Elzanowski and Wellnhofer noted that the specimen has distinct bite marks while the back of the head fragment was ragged , and suggested that the jaws were bitten off from its braincase by a deltatheridiid ( ' ' Deltatheridium ' ' ) mammal the size of a weasel ( adding that these are common in the Bayn Dzak assemblage ) . Clark and colleagues ( 2002 ) noted that it may have also passed through the digestive tract of the predator before fossilization . If true , this may be the first known evidence of Mesozoic mammals feeding on dinosaurs ( see ' ' Repenomamus ' ' ) .
