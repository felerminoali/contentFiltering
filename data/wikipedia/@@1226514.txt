Peter John Collins ( 6 November 1931 &amp;ndash ; 3 August 1958 ) was a Formula One driver from England . He participated in 35 World Championship Grands Prix , debuting on 18 May 1952 . He won 3 races , achieved 9 podiums , and scored a total of 47 championship points . # Early life and racing career # Peter Collins was born on 6 November 1931 . He grew up in Mustow Green , on the south side of Kidderminster in Worcestershire , United Kingdom . The son of a motor garage owner and haulage merchant , Collins became interested in motor vehicles at a young age . At 16 he was expelled from school after having been caught riding dodgem cars at a local fairground during school hours . Becoming an apprentice in his fathers garage , he soon began competing in local trials races . In common with many British drivers of the immediate post-war period , Collins cut his racing teeth in the frenetic 500cc category ( adopted as Formula 3 at the end of 1950 ) , when his parents bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These small machines , powered by motorcycle engines , were also the proving ground of many of Collins ' F1 contemporaries , notably including Stirling Moss . # Later career # Collins joined the Aston Martin sports car team in 1952 , and scored a sensational victory at the 1952 Goodwood Nine Hours race . The following year , he took the Aston Martin DB3S he shared with Pat Griffith to victory in the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod . Collins got his Formula One break in 1952 , driving for the lowly HWM team , replacing Stirling Moss . Results did not come the team 's way , and Collins left after the 1953 season . Following spells driving for Vanwall and Maserati , together with a brief outing in a BRM which ended with a crash in qualifying , Collins signed with Ferrari for the 1956 F1 season . Collins ' 1956 season with Ferrari proved to be a turning point , with a solid second place finish behind Moss at Monaco , and wins at the Belgian and French Grands Prix . Indeed , Collins was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed his Lancia-Ferrari D50 over to team leader Juan Manuel Fangio after the latter suffered a steering-arm failure toward the end of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza . Collins eventually finished second , but the advantage handed to Moss , and the extra points gained by Fangio 's finish , demoted Collins to third place in the championship . Collins ' selfless act gained him respect from Enzo Ferrari and high praise from Fangio : I was moved almost to tears by the gesture .. Peter was one of the finest and greatest gentlemen I ever met in my racing career . In 1956 , Collins moved to Monaco in order to avoid compulsory military service in the British Army and thus continue his racing career . In January 1957 Collins married American actress Louise King and the couple took up residence on a yacht in Monaco harbour . The same year , Collins was joined at Ferrari by Mike Hawthorn . The two became very close friends , even arranging to split their winnings between each other , and together engaged in a fierce rivalry with fellow Ferrari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Nrburgring , Ferrari were distinctly under-par for much of the season as the 801 model ( an evolution of the 1954 Lancia D50 ) was overweight and underpowered. 1958 saw the introduction of the new and improved Ferrari Dino 246 and once again results began to go the way of Scuderia Ferrari . Although achieving few results in the first half of the season , Collins improved and won the non championship International Trophy . However Enzo Ferrari felt Collins was distracted by his supposed playboy lifestyle . The Monaco yacht where he lived was considered a perpetual party by Ferrari who thought Collins was distracted and no longer focused on driving and developing sports cars . Collins was sacked by Ferrari after deliberately wrecking the clutch in his car , that he shared with Mike Hawthorn , during the Le Mans 24 hours rather than race in a rainstorm , and was found drinking in a pub in England before the end of the race ! Ferrari relented and allowed Collins to drive an F2 car until the end of the season , perhaps hoping to pacify Hawthorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Rheims , Hawthorn refused to start unless Collins was allowed to start in a F1 car . He did , and finished fifth . Ferrari immediately sacked Collins again . Hawthorn responded by flying to Italy and storming Ferrari headquarters in Modena . Having smashed down locked doors , Mike Hawthorn told Enzo Ferrari he would never drive another race for him unless Collins was given his Formula One seat again . Ferrari , perhaps sensibly , relented ! At Silverstone during the British Grand Prix , Collins responded with perhaps his greatest drive . Under team orders and his own wish to help his friend Hawthorn win the Championship , Collins led from the start , running flat out and more at 11/10 in an effort to break the Moss-driven Vanwall and in an inferior car to the main protagonists driving on the limit for 45 laps , gradually pulling away from Moss until his Vanwall expired and Collins won . The Ferrari team management decided not to slow Collins down and flag Hawthorn through to the win after Collins ' great drive . Stirling 's future patron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Collins ' drive frightening and he should never drive like that again . It was his third and final career victory . That season he also took a third place at Monaco . # Death # During the 1958 German Grand Prix at the Nrburgring , whilst chasing Tony Brooks ' Vanwall , disaster struck . Pushing hard to keep pace , Collins went into the Pflanzgarten section of the circuit , entered a turn too quickly causing his Ferrari to run wide and strike a ditch on the left side of the road . Collins lost control and flipped into the air and landed upside down . Though Collins was thrown clear as the car somersaulted , he struck a tree , sustaining critical head injuries . Despite being taken to hospital , Collins died later that afternoon . His death was almost identical to the manner in which his Ferrari team mate Luigi Musso died . Team mate Mike Hawthorn was so disturbed by Collins ' death that he retired from racing immediately after winning the 1958 Driver 's Championship . Hawthorn would himself die the following year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Guildford . # Rivalry with Luigi Musso # Many years after the death of Peter Collins , Fiamma Breschi , Luigi Musso 's girlfriend at the time of his death , revealed in a television documentary entitled ' ' The Secret Life of Enzo Ferrari ' ' the nature of the rivalry between team-mates Collins , Hawthorn and Musso . Breschi recalled that the antagonism between Musso and the two English drivers encouraged all three to take risks : The Englishmen ( Hawthorn and Collins ) had an agreement , she says . Whichever of them won , they would share the winnings equally . It was the two of them against Luigi , who was not part of the agreement . Strength comes in numbers , and they were united against him . This antagonism was actually favourable rather than damaging to Ferrari . The faster the drivers went , the more likely it was that a Ferrari would win . # Racing record # # Complete World Drivers Championship results # ( key ; * shared drive ) # Non-Championship results # ( key ) ( Races in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ italics ' ' indicate fastest lap )
