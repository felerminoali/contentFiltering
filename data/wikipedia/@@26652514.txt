: ' ' This is an article on Mithraism in comparative mythology and comparative theology . See Mithraic mysteries for the main article . ' ' The Roman cult of Mithras had connections with other pagan deities , Syncretism being a prominent feature of Roman paganism . Almost all Mithraea contain statues dedicated to gods of other cults , and it is common to find inscriptions dedicated to Mithras in other sanctuaries , especially those of Jupiter Dolichenus . Mithraism was not an alternative to other pagan religions , but rather a particular way of practising pagan worship ; and many Mithraic initiates can also be found worshipping in the civic religion , and as initiates of other mystery cults . However , in popular culture and especially among the New Atheist movement , the most widely discussed element of Mithras in the context of comparative religion is his relationship with Christianity . Connections with the figure of Jesus himself have even been posited but are generally ignored by scholars . More widely discussed are a few apparent similarities between early Christian liturgical practice and the Mithraic rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been subject to varying interpretations over time . # Comparisons with contemporary Roman gods # # Phanes # Orphic speculation influenced the cult of Mithras at times . In Orphism , Phanes emerged from the world egg at the beginning of time , bringing the universe into existence . There is some literary evidence of the syncretism of Mithras and Phanes . A list of the eight elements of creation appears in Zenobius and Theon of Smyrna ; most of the elements are the same , but in Zenobius the seventh element is ' Mithras ' , in Theon it is ' Phanes ' . A Greek inscription on a statue base from a Mithraeum in Rome reads to Deus Sol Mithras Phanes . A relief from Vercovium ( Housesteads ) on Hadrian 's Wall shows Mithras emerging from the cosmic egg , which is represented both as such and by the shape of the zodiacal ring . Ulansey adds : : The identification between Mithras and Phanes indicated by CIMRM 860 is also explicitly attested by an inscription found in Rome dedicated to ' **26;31768;TOOLONG ' and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Modena . This shows Phanes coming from an egg with flames shooting out around him , surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac , in an image very similar to that at Newcastle . Further references also exist . # Sol Invictus # Mithras is given the title deus sol invictus ( unconquered sun god ) in several inscriptions . The vagueness of the term ' ' invictus ' ' means that it was widely used . Mithraism never became a state cult , however , unlike the official late Roman Sol Invictus cult . # Jupiter Dolichenus # The Mithraea at Carnuntum appear to have been constructed in close association with contemporary temple of Jupiter Dolichenus , and there seem to have been considerable similarities between the two cults ; both being mystery cults with secret liturgies , both being popular in the military , and having similar names for their officials and intitiates . Two large Mithrea have been discovered in Doliche itself ( modern Gaziantep in Turkey ) , which have been proposed as being unusually early . # Helios/Sol # Although Mithras himself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Sol appear in several scenes as separate persons , with the banquet scene being the most prominent example . Other scenes feature Mithras ascending behind Sol in the latter 's chariot , the deities shaking hands and the two gods at an altar with pieces of meat on a spit or spits . One peculiar scene shows Sol kneeling before Mithras , who holds an object , interpreted either as a Persian cap or the haunch of the bull , in his hand . # Mithraism and Christianity # The idea of a relationship between early Christianity and Mithraism is based on a remark in the 2nd-century Christian writer Justin Martyr , who accused the Mithraists of diabolically imitating the Christian communion rite . Based upon this statement , Ernest Renan in 1882 set forth a vivid depiction of two rival religions : if the growth of Christianity had been arrested by some mortal malady , the world would have been Mithraic . Edwin M. Yamauchi questions the validity of Renan 's inference , which , published nearly 150 years ago , has no value as a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars , among them Ronald Nash and Edwin Yamauchi , have suggested a different interpretation of Mithraism 's relationship to Christianity . Yamauchi , pointing out that most of the textual evidence for Mithraist doctrine was written after the New Testament was in broad circulation , posits that it is more likely that Mithraism borrowed from Christianity than the other way around . The philosopher Celsus in the second century provides some evidence that Ophite gnostic ideas were influencing the mysteries of Mithras. # Virgin birth # It is sometimes said that the birth of Mithras was a virgin birth , like that of Jesus . Anahita was said to have conceived the Mithras from the seed of Zarathustra preserved in the waters of Lake Hamun in the Persian province of Sistan . In other , contradictory traditions , he is also born without any sex but from the rock wall of a cave . One must know that there were separate Mithra traditions that may have changed and been adapted over time . This information comes from a Temple that bears this inscription dedicated to Anahita and dated to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief derived from the Perseus myths , which held he was born from an underground cavern . # 25th of December # It is often stated that Mithras was thought to have been born on December 25 . But Beck states that this is not the case . In fact he calls this assertion that hoariest of ' facts ' . He continues : In truth , the only evidence for it is the celebration of the birthday of Invictus on that date in Calendar of Philocalus . ' ' Invictus ' ' is of course ' ' Sol Invictus ' ' , Aurelian 's sun god . It does not follow that a different , earlier , and unofficial sun god , ' ' Sol Invictus Mithras ' ' , was necessarily or even probably , born on that day too . Unusually amongst Roman mystery cults , the mysteries of Mithras had no ' public ' face ; worship of Mithras was confined to initiates , and they could only undertake such worship in the secrecy of the Mithraeum . Clauss states : the Mithraic Mysteries had no public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natalis Invicti ' ' Birth of the Unconquerable ( Sun ) , held on 25 December , was a general festival of the Sun , and by no means specific to the Mysteries of Mithras . . Steven Hijmans has discussed in detail the question of whether the general ' ' natalis Invicti ' ' festival was related to Christmas but does not give Mithras as a possible source . # Salvation # A painted text on the wall of the St. Prisca Mithraeum ( c A.D. 200 ) in Rome contains the words : ' ' et nos servasti ( ? ) . . . sanguine fuso ' ' ( ' ' and you have saved us .. in the shed blood ' ' ) . The meaning of this text is unclear , although presumably it refers to the bull killed by Mithras , as no other source refers to a Mithraic salvation . However the ' ' servasti ' ' is only a conjecture . According to Robert Turcan , Mithraic salvation had little to do with the other-worldly destiny of individual souls , but was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good creation against the forces of evil . # Symbolism of water # Monuments in the Danube area depict Mithras firing a bow at a rock in the presence of the torch-bearers , apparently to encourage water to come forth . Clauss states that , after the ritual meal , this water-miracle offers the clearest parallel with Christianity . # Sign of the cross # Tertullian states that followers of Mithras were marked on their forehead in an unspecified manner . There is no indication that this mark was made in the form of a cross , or a branding , or a tattoo , or a permanent mark of any kind . The symbol of a circle with a diagonal cross inscribed within it is commonly found in Mithraea , especially in association with the Leontocephaline figure . # Mithraic motifs and medieval Christian art # From the end of the 18th century some scholars have suggested that certain elements in medieval Christian art reflect images found in Mithraic reliefs . Franz Cumont was among these scholars , although he studied each motif in isolation rather than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian church over paganism , artists continued to make use of stock images originally devised for Mithras in order to depict the new and unfamiliar stories of the bible . The stranglehold of the workshop meant that the first Christian artworks were heavily based on pagan art , and a few alterations in costume and attitude transformed a pagan scene into a Christian picture . A series of scholars have since discussed possible similarities with Mithraic reliefs in medieval Romanesque art . Vermaseren stated that the only certain example of such influence was an image of Elijah drawn up to heaven in a chariot drawn by fiery horses . Deman stated that to compare isolated elements was not useful , and that combinations should be studied . He also pointed out that a similarity of image does not tell us whether this implies an ideological influence , or merely a tradition of craftmanship . He then gave a list of medieval reliefs that parallel Mithraic images , but refused to draw conclusions from such parallels , since these would be subjective .
