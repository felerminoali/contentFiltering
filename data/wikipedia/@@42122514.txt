location=Leipzig ( version 1 ) * * /1732 ? location=Leipzig ( version 3 ) * location=Leipzig ( version 4 ) text = anonymous chorale = stanzas from 9 chorales ( version 1 ) The structure of Johann Sebastian Bach 's ' ' St John Passion ' ' ( ' ' ' ' ) , BWV 245 , is shown in tables below . The original Latin title ' ' ' ' translates to The Passion after John . Bach 's large choral composition , written to be performed in a Lutheran service on Good Friday , is based on the Passion , as told in two chapters from the Gospel of John in the translation by Martin Luther , and , with two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew . During the vespers service , the two parts of the work were performed before and after the sermon . Part I covers the events until Peter 's denial of Jesus , Part II concludes with the burial of Jesus . The Bible text is reflected in contemporary poetry and in chorales that often end a scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Bach cantatas . An anonymous poet supplied a few texts himself , quoted from other Passion texts and inserted chorales by nine hymnwriters . Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 in Leipzig 's . He repeated it several times between 1724 and 1749 , experimenting with different movements and changes to others , resulting in four versions . The Passion , close to Bach 's heart , has an immediate dramatic quality . # Structure # # Text # # # Gospel # # The gospel account by John narrates the story in five scenes .

Possibly Bach had an influence on their selection . He set them all in common time for four parts , the instruments playing with the voices . Five chorales conclude a scene ( in movements 5 , 14 , 26 , 37 and 40 ) , a chorale opens Part II ( 15 ) . Five chorales comment within a scene ( 3 , 11 , 17 , 22 , 28 ) . including the central movement of the whole Passion ( 22 ) . One chorale accompanies the bass soloist in an aria ( 32 ) . Most chorale texts were written in the 16th and 17th century , by authors of the Reformation such as Martin Luther , Martin Schalling and Michael Weie , and by hymn writers including Paul Gerhardt and Johann Heermann . The central chorale is not part of a common hymn . # # Contemporary text # # On a third level of text , contemporary poetry reflects the biblical narration .

Bach added some instruments in arias for special effects , old-fashioned already at the time , such as lute , viola d'amore and viola da gamba ( Vg ) . Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) , singing the words of Jesus , from the other bass recitatives and arias , nor the evangelist from the tenor arias . # Symmetry # The work displays a thoughtful Symmetry#In music # Versions # Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 In version 2 , Bach opened with a chorale fantasia on In version 3 , after Bach wrote his ' ' St Matthew Passion ' ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bach returned to the first version , possibly in 1739 , but revised it thoroughly . He began a new score which covers 12 movements . As Christoph Wolff observes : The fragmentary revised score constitutes an extensive stylistic overhaul with painstaking improvements to the part-writing and a partial restructuring of the instrumentation ; particular attention was paid to the word-setting in the recitatives and the continuo accompaniment . Wolff writes : Bach experimented with the St John Passion as he did with no other large-scale composition , # Tables of movements # The following tables give an overview of version I of the Passion , first performed in 1724 . Two versions of movement numbers are given , first that of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe ( NBA ) , then that of the older Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis ( BWV ) . Voices appear in one of three columns , depending on the text source , Bible , contemporary poetic reflection , and chorale .
