Puch is a manufacturing company located in Graz , Austria . The company was founded in 1889 by the industrialist Johann Puch and produced automobiles , bicycles , mopeds , and motorcycles. # Pre 1919 # Johann Puch first produced bicycles in 1889 in a small workshop called ' ' Fahrradfabrikation Strauchergasse 18 a ' ' in Graz . Ten years later he founded his company , ' ' Erste Steiermrkische Fahrradfabrik AG ' ' ( en : First Styrian Bicycle Factory AG ) . Puch 's company became successful through innovation and quality handicraft , rapidly expanding over time . It soon began producing motorcycles and mopeds . The main production plant , later called ' ' Einser-Werk ' ' , was constructed in the south of Graz , in the district of Puntigam . Production of engines was started in 1901 and cars followed in 1904 . In 1906 the production of the two-cylinder Puch Voiturette began and in 1909 a Puch car broke the world high-speed record with 130,4 km/h . In 1910 , Puch is known to have produced sedans for members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsepower ) Type VIII ' ' Alpenwagen ' ' was developed . In 1912 Johann Puch went into retirement and became the company 's honorary president . In that year the company employed about 1,100 workers and produced 16,000 bicycles and over 300 motorcycles and cars annually . During World War I , Puch became an important vehicle supplier to the Austro-Hungarian Army . However with the collapse of the empire following the War , the market for automobiles shrank and production was discontinued . # Between wars # In 1923 an Italian engineer Giovanni Marcellino is said to have been sent by the banks to wind up the Puch factory in Graz . Instead of which , within a few weeks he had settled down to live in the town , designing and then producing a new version of the split-single . Taking his inspiration from industrial counter-piston engines , the new engine benefited from the improved breathing of the Italian original , to which he added asymmetric port timing . In 1931 Puch won the German Grand Prix with a supercharged split-single , though in subsequent years the split-singles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Austro-Daimler and became a part of the new Austro-Daimler-Puchwerke . This company in its turn merged in 1934 with Steyr AG to form Steyr-Daimler-Puch. # WWII # Like all enterprises of its kind , the Puch production plants had to change to arms production during World War II . The existing capacity was insufficient , therefore a second plant was constructed and opened in 1941 in Thondorf , Graz . In the three original assembly halls , luxury vehicles for the American market were produced . Steyr-Daimler-Puch is one of the companies known to have benefited from slave labor housed in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp system during World War II . Slaves from the camp ( who had initially been worked to death in quarries ) started to be used in a highly profitable system used by 45 engineering and war-effort companies , and amongst them Puch had an underground factory built at Gusen in 1943. # Post-War years # During the period immediately after the war , late 1945 to 1947 , the factory was requisitioned and run by the British Army ( R.E.M.E. ) who used the facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servicing of British and American military vehicles . In 1949 , an assembly cooperation agreement was signed with Fiat in Turin . The 1950s to the mid-1970s saw a sharp increase in production of motorcycles , bicycles and mopeds . Even though Puch was a part of Steyr-Daimler-Puch , it still produced products under its own name , as well as for Steyr-Puch and other companies .

These machines developed a reputation for reliability and were popular for daily commuting , providing good weather protection and ease of use . In this role their moderate performance , with a top speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models had a 150cc engine and foot-operation , giving better performance of 6 hp instead of 5 hp but retaining the three gears. # Puch mopeds # Puch produced the Puch Maxi , Puch Newport , and MK mopeds , which were popular from the late 1970s to early 1980s . In Austria and the Netherlands , Puch mopeds played a big role in the 1960s popular culture . Puch mopeds in Sweden were , and still are , very popular . They were all named after US states , except the Maxi and the Monza . Some of the more popular models were : **6;445302;br The Dakota ( VZ 50 ) 50cc fan-cooled , 3speed gearbox .

Many different models appeared including the Challenger , Invader and Trak Pro . In 1981 they worked with Speed Unlimited in Wayne , New Jersey to manufacture a line of high end BMX race bikes . Speed Unlimited also made bikes for Hutch and their own brand Thruster . The model they made for Puch was the Trak Pro . In 1981 Puch also began sponsoring BMX racers across the United States . The green , black and white uniform was soon showing up at BMX tracks across America , especially in the Northeast .

It was started using the pedals which could be engaged and disengaged from the engine via a starting lever so it could be ridden as a normal bicycle . Later models did not have pedals , and instead were started with a kick start mechanism . # Puch motorcycle marketed as the Twingle # # Legacy # In the late 1980s , the company was being squeezed out by competition . In 1987 , massive restructuring of the company led to the end of the production of two-wheelers in Graz . The company 's technical know-how was always better than its marketing and commercial success . The Puch motorcycle company was sold to Piaggio , maker of the Vespa , in 1987 and still produces bikes under the name Puch . When the bicycle division of Piaggio , which also included Bianchi Bicycles was sold to the Swedish Grimaldi Industri group in 1997 , Puch became part of Cycleurope . In 2011 , Austrian entrepreneur Josef Faber took control of the brand , with the 2012 line of bicycles manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel drive vehicles and parts , still exists next to the Piaggio division . The so-called ' ' Einserwerk ' ' , the first production plant , shut down in the early 2000s . The historical assembly-hall was declared a protected industrial monument . When Graz became European Capital of Culture in 2003 , a Puch museum was opened in one of the former assembly halls . Puch sold the entire production line of Puch Maxi Plus to Hero Motors when production ended in Austria . It spawned the Hero Puch that sold extremely well in India from 1988 till end of 2003 when production ended .
