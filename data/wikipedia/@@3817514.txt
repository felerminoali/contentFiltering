Akabia ben Mahalalel ( ) , was a Jewish religious teacher , probably of the second tannaitic generation ( 1st and 2nd centuries ) . Of his early history nothing is known ; there are no references to his teachers and comparatively few of his sayings have been preserved . The ' ' Mishnah ' ' portrays him as a man who fearlessly and persistently maintained opinions on some ' ' halakhot ' ' , even in cases where different traditions were held by the majority of his colleagues , because those opinions were founded on traditions he had received from his predecessors . On one occasion the majority demanded that he renounce his divergent opinions , but he refused . It was even intimated to him that in the event of his compliance he would be elevated to the position of ' ' Av Beit Din ' ' ( president of the court ) , but Akabia rejected the proposition , remarking , I would rather be called a fool all my lifetime than be a sinner for one moment . His traditional burial location is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discussion of the halakah concerning the administration of the water of jealousy ( ' ' Num. ' ' 5:11-31 ) , Akabia declared that , if the subject of the test was not a free-born Jewess , the test-water was not to be administered ; while the majority declared a proselyte or an emancipated slave to be the equal of a free-born daughter in Israel . In support of their view the majority cited a case in point , where the former associate presidents of the Sanhedrin , Shemaiah and Abtalion , had the test made on a freed woman ; whereupon Akabia disdainfully exclaimed , ' ' Dugma hishuha . ' ' This might mean To one like themselves they gave to drink , and may be construed as an allusion to an old rumor to the effect that these associate presidents were themselves lineal descendants of proselytes ; or it might mean They gave her a sham to drink . The memory of those chiefs being held in esteem , Akabia 's insinuation gave offense ; wherefore the sentence of ' ' nidduy ' ' ( isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore to the end of his days rather than violate his convictions . However , before his death , he admonished his son to submit to the views of the majority , even in the cases where he himself had shown such persistent opposition . His son expressing surprise at so apparent an inconsistency , the dying sage replied : I have received my tradition from a majority of a school in my days , and so have my opponents . I was bound to conform to the tradition I had received ; and so are they bound by their tradition . But thou hast heard the traditions both from myself and from my opponents ; from a minority and from a majority , and it is proper for thee to reject the opinions of the individual and adopt the views of the majority . Another characteristic trait of ' Akabia was the great stress he laid on personal merit . When , on his deathbed , he was requested by his son to recommend him to the sages , he declined to do so . His son inquired whether his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy of such recommendation ; and ' Akabia 's reply was , No ! but thine own deeds will make thee welcome , or thine own deeds will make thee obnoxious . Akabia 's motto in life was : Remember whence thou hast come , whither thou goest , and before whom thou must be prepared to render an account of thy doings . Beyond this maxim and the ' ' halakot ' ' enumerated above , nothing from him has been transmitted . As to his epoch scholars are divided . While some place him in the patriarchate of Hillel I ( 30 BC to 10 of the present era ) , and even somewhat earlier , others bring him down to the first tannaitic generation ( 10-80 ) ; still others believe that he flourished during the patriarchate of Gamaliel II ( 80-117 ) . The circumstances and scholastic achievements of the second tannaitic generation render Akabia 's excommunication more reasonable . The decree of excommunication failed to obscure Akabia 's merited fame ; for his name reached subsequent generations surrounded by such a halo of glory as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaims Judah b . Ilai , one of the ' ' tannaim ' ' of the fourth generation ( 139-165 ) , that we should think that Akabia was excommunicated , for the Temple gates were never closed behind a man in Israel so great in wisdom and in the fear of sin as was Akabia ben Mahalalel . This expression , which is based on the law forbidding an excommunicated person to enter the Temple court , was in later days taken literally , and gave rise to forced ' ' halakic ' ' discussions and comments , as well as to hypothetical speculations about the age of Akabia . Elsewhere it is said , Whoever asserts that Akabia was ever excommunicated will have to answer before the tribunal of heaven . This observation is wrongly attributed to Judah b . Betera I ; and conclusions as to Akabia 's early age are erroneously deduced therefrom . # Bibliography # *Nehemiah Brll , ' ' Mebo ha-Mishnah , ' ' i.49 *Zecharias Frankel , ' ' Darke ha-Mishnah , ' ' pp. 56 et seq . *Heinrich Grtz , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iv.39 *Isaak Markus Jost , ' ' Geschichte des Judenthums und seiner Sekten ' ' , ii.34 *I .
