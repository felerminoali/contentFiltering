The tickets instructed the Scouts to attend in patrols of 9 , and each were good for one showing . The show was presented every 20 minutes but lasted over an hour . Each presentation of the program had three groups of four patrols of 9 Scouts each , that is , 108 people . No-shows were filled in with Scouts from a standby line . After doubling the amount of money spent on the jamboree , The Mysterium Compass cost over $1,000,000 to produce and had a staff of just above 300 . It was closed to anyone over 18 . Participants who completed the show were given a medallion for their jamboree emblem patches . # Arena shows # The 2010 National Scout Jamboree featured two arena shows : one on July 28 , and another one was held on July 31 . Both arena shows featured Chief Scout Executive Bob Mazzuca . The first arena show featured several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates . The main arena show featured Mike Rowe , host of Discovery Channel 's ' ' Dirty Jobs ' ' , and musical performances by Alex Boy , Honor Society and Switchfoot . The show ended with the largest fireworks display ever performed on a military base or at a national Scout jamboree . There was some controversy over President Obama not appearing , as he had chosen to pre-record his appearance on The View that day - instead leaving a video message congratulating the Boy Scouts of America on their centennial . At the 2005 jamboree , there were problems with a water shortage during the first arena show . This was not repeated in the second show or in those at the 2010 jamboree . Cases of water bottles were distributed everywhere on the arena seating area , with large stacks at the sides , back , and along the roads to the arena . In total , approximate three-quarters of a million bottles of water were placed in the arena during the 2010 National Scout Jamboree - in order to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their camps from the second arena show after dark , some participants without flashlights had trouble avoiding running into extra cases of water bottles as they lay on the ground and the roads . A few others carried cases back to their camps because the water in the bottles tasted better than that distributed in the water system . # Social networking # There was a focus on social networking at this jamboree which was entirely new . Generally , Scouts are instructed to leave their electronics at home when on camping trips , but this event was an exception . AT&amp;T , one of the corporate sponsors , provided excellent cell phone coverage and a Wi-Fi network which spanned the entire site . This effected a better signal in the jamboree site than in most residential areas . AT&amp;T also provided netbooks and cell phones for use by the Scouts in their Connection Centers , located throughout the site . There were also secure device charging lockers next to each connection center where phones or other devices could be recharged , although this set-up became controversial after scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a personal charging station . The jamboree trading posts sponsored competitions for videos and pictures submitted by participants . Staff members and signs placed around the site encouraged Scouts to tell about their experiences on various social websites . This allowed parents , siblings , and friends at home to get in on the action and see what was happening . Overall , the event was covered extensively on the internet as well as in local and national news . # Deaths # A staff member was found dead in his bed on August 3 , 2010 ; the cause of the death was cardiac dysrhythmia
