Angel hair or siliceous cotton is a sticky , fibrous substance reported in connection with UFO sightings , or manifestations of the Virgin Mary . It has been described as being like a cobweb or a jelly . It is named for its similarity to fine hair , or spider webs , and in some cases the substance has been found to be the web threads of migrating spiders . Reports of angel hair say that it disintegrates or evaporates within a short time of forming . Angel hair is an important aspect of the UFO religion Ralism , and one theory among ufologists is that it is created from ionized air sleeting off an electromagnetic field that surrounds a UFO. # Sightings # There have been many reports of falls of angel hair around the world . Angel hair was reported during the 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg and also at the Miracle at Fatima on the 13th of September and October 1917 . The most reported incidence occurred in Oloron , France in 1952 . On October 27 , 1954 , Gennaro Lucetti and Pietro Lastrucci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Square in Venice and saw two shining spindles flying across the sky leaving a trail of the angel hair . In the Portuguese city of vora on November 2 , 1959 , angel hair was collected and analyzed under a microscope by a local school director and later by armed forces technicians and scientists of the University of Lisbon . The scientists concluded that the angel hair was produced by a small insect or perhaps some kind of single-celled organism . In New Zealand and Australia local newspapers have reported many sightings since the 1950s , although many have been identified as spider webs after analysis . # Published explanations # Explanations based on known phenomena include : *Some types of spiders are known to migrate through the air , sometimes in large numbers , on cobweb gliders . Many cases of angel hair were nothing other than these spider threads and , in one occasion , small spiders have been found on the material . Linyphiidae spiders frequently cause showers of gossamer threads in England and the Northern hemisphere . Australia and New Zealand have frequent cases , caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of Linyphiidae. *Atmospheric electricity may cause floating dust particles to become polarized , and attraction between these polarized dust particles may cause them to join together , to form long filaments . *On two occasions a sample was sent for testing once on the 13 of October in 1917 a sample found at Cova da Iria was sent to Lisbon and on October 17 , 1957 another sample found at Cova da Iria and examined . The analysis of this proved to be natural consisting of white flakes . When put under a microscope it was found to be a vegetable product not animal . Non-scientific explanations based upon a belief in Unidentified Flying Objects include : *Ionized air may be sleeting off the electromagnetic field that surrounds a UFO. *Excess energy converted into matter . *The usage by UFOs of a G-field would cause heavy atoms in ordinary air to react among themselves and produce a kind of precipitate that falls to the ground and disappears as the ionization decreases . # Angel grass # Angel grass is a related phenomenon .
