He played two seasons for the Dallas Cowboys ( 19741975 ) and one for the San Diego Chargers ( 1976 ) . Longley earned his nickname the Mad Bomber for bouncing passes off of Coach Tom Landry 's coaching tower in the Cowboys ' training camp . He played college football at Abilene Christian University . # Early years # After attending Littleton High School , he enrolled at Abilene Christian University without a scholarship . In 1973 as a junior , he led the nation 's small colleges in passing and total offense , with 3,167 yards and 28 touchdowns . He set a school record by passing for 434 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-7 victory against Southwest Texas State University .

He passed up his senior year in 1974 to enter the NFL. # Professional career # # Dallas Cowboys # Because he left college before his final year of eligibility , he entered the free agent pool in 1974 where he was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals and eventually traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a fifth round draft choice . During that season he was named the backup quarterback to Roger Staubach , after having a strong training camp and the trade of Craig Morton to the New York Giants . He is best remembered for his performance in a Thanksgiving Day game in 1974 against the Washington Redskins . Longley then a rookie , came into the game for an injured Roger Staubach with the Cowboys trailing 16-3 in the third quarter , and facing elimination from the playoffs . After hitting Billy Joe Dupree for a 35-yard touchdown pass , he led the Cowboys on a 70-yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , with the Cowboys behind 23-17 and with only 28 seconds left with no time outs , Longley hit Drew Pearson down the middle for a 50-yard hail mary pass touchdown which gave the Cowboys a dramatic 24-23 come from behind victory . Because Longley had no expectation of playing in that game and was completely unprepared , Cowboys lineman Blaine Nye sarcastically called his winning effort the triumph of the uncluttered mind . The game was named the second-best in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN in 2008 . After a training room incident in which he punched Roger Staubach during the 1976 preseason , the team suspended and eventually traded him to the San Diego Chargers for first and second draft choices , that the Cowboys would eventually use to draft Tony Dorsett. # San Diego Chargers # The San Diego Chargers traded for him with the intention of creating a competition with Dan Fouts , but decided to waive him the following year during the 1977 training camp . # Toronto Argonauts ( CFL ) # He spent part of the 1977 season with the Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Saint Louis Cardinals # The Saint Louis Cardinals signed him in 1978 , but eventually waived him before the season started . # Hamilton Tiger-Cats ( CFL ) # After a year out of football , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats signed him in 1980 , but he could n't make the roster. # Roger Staubach incident # Unfortunately , less than two years after his Thanksgiving Day heroics , Longley , under pressure from Danny White for the back-up QB role , left the Cowboys in disgrace after he landed a blindside punch on Staubach during training camp in Thousand Oaks , California . The infamous sucker punch occurred after Longley and Staubach had fought over a negative remark Longley made about Staubach to fellow Cowboy teammates . Staubach was putting on his shoulder pads on the last day of training camp when Longley hit him in the face without warning and from behind , requiring several stitches to close the wound on Staubach 's face . Longley was immediately traded to the San Diego Chargers where he finished his career with little more success . Apparently , there is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthing off about teammates , but Gil Brandt said the tiff between Staubach and Longley began with a simple game of boredom . ' Roger always could bounce the football off the ground to come right back to him , ' Brandt said . ' He 'd do it over and over . They 'd have contests , and Clint could n't do it . ' Longley challenged Roger to a fight . Roger told him they were going to meet on another field after practice . ' Staubach and Longley took off their helmets and pads . ' They got after it , ' Brandt said . ' Roger beat the hell out of him . ' Assistant coach Dan Reeves had to break up the fight . Later , Longley sucker-punched Staubach in the dressing room . ' Tex ( Schramm ) had enough , ' Brandt said . ' He told me to get rid of Longley immediately , so we traded him to San Diego for a first-round pick we used to help us get ( running back ) Tony Dorsett in the next draft .
