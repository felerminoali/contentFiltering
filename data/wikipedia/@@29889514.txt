From its earliest days , Christianity has been challenged to reconcile the violence of the Christian Bible with the idea of a loving God . Ra'anan S. Boustan asserts that ( v ) iolence can be found throughout the pages of the Hebrew Bible ( Old Testament ) and the New Testament . Philip Jenkins describes the Bible as overflowing with texts of terror . In response to these charges of violence in their scriptures , many Christian theologians and apologists respond that the God of the Old Testament is a violent god whereas the God of the New Testament is a peaceful and loving god , an exegesis first proposed by Marcion of Sinope . This approach is challenged by those who point out that there are also passages in the New Testament that tolerate , condone and even encourage the use of violence . For example , Terence Freitheim describes the Old Testament as a book filled with ... the violence of God . He asserts that while the New Testament does not have the same reputation , it too is filled with violent words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament are complicit in this violence . John Hemer asserts that the two primary approaches that Christian teaching uses to deal with the problem of violence in the Old Testament are : # Concentrate more on the many passages where God is depicted as loving much of Isaiah , Hosea , Micah , Deuteronomy. # Explain how the idea of God as a violent punishing war-monger is all part of the historical and cultural conditioning of the author and that we can ignore it in good faith , especially in the light of the New Testament . In opposition to these two approaches , Hemer argues that to ignore or explain away the violence found in the Old Testament is a mistake . He asserts that Violence is not peripheral to the Bible it is central , in many ways it is the issue , because of course it is the human problem . He concludes by saying that The Bible is in fact the story of the slow , painstaking and sometimes faltering escape from the idea of a God who is violent to a God who is love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthews assert that many studies of violence in the Bible focus on violence in the Old Testament while ignoring or giving little attention to the New Testament . They find even more troubling those studies that lift up the New Testament as somehow containing the antidote for Old Testament violence . This apparent contradiction in the sacred scriptures between a God of vengeance and a God of love are the basis of a tension between the irenic and eristic tendencies of Christianity that has continued to the present day . # Old Testament # The principle of an eye for an eye is often referred to using the Latin phrase ' ' lex talionis ' ' , the law of like . The meaning of the principle eye for an eye is that a person who has injured another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation . At the root of this principle is that one of the purposes of the law is to provide equitable retribution for an offended party . Christian interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the quotation from Leviticus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mount . In the Expounding of the Law ( part of the Sermon on the Mount ) , Jesus urges his followers to turn the other cheek when confronted by violence : # You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . But I say to you , do not resist an evildoer . If anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . ( , NRSV ) # This saying of Jesus is frequently interpreted as criticism of the Old Testament teaching , and often taken as implying that an eye for an eye encourages excessive vengeance rather than an attempt to limit it . It was one of the points of ' fulfilment or destruction ' of the Hebrew law which the Church father St. Augustine already discussed in his Contra Faustum , Book XIX . Dr Ian Guthridge cited many instances of genocide in the Old Testament : thus leading many scholars to characterize the exterminations as genocide . Niels Peter Lemche asserts that European colonialism in the 19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extermination . The image of a violent God in Hebrew scriptures that condoned and even ordered violence posed a problem for some early Christians who saw this as a direct contradiction to the God of peace and love attested to in the New Testament . Perhaps the most famous example was Marcion who dropped the Hebrew scriptures from his version of the Bible because he found in them a violent God . Marcion saw the God of the Old Testament , the Demiurge and creator of the material universe , as a jealous tribal deity of the Jews , whose law represented legalistic reciprocal justice and who punishes mankind for its sins by suffering and death . Marcion wrote that the God of the Old Testament was an uncultured , jealous , wild , belligerent , angry and violent God , who has nothing in common with the God of the New Testament .. For Marcion , the God about whom Jesus was an altogether different being , a universal God of compassion and love , who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy . Marcion argued that Christianity should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to say that Jesus mission was to overthrow Demiurgethe fickle , cruel , despotic God of the Old Testamentand replace Him with the Supreme God of Love whom Jesus came to reveal . Marcion 's teaching was repudiated by Tertullian in five treatises titled Against Marcion and Marcion was ultimately excommunicated by the Church of Rome . The difficulty posed by the apparent contradiction between the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament continues to perplex pacifist Christians to this day . Eric Seibert asserts that , ( f ) or many Christians , involvement in warfare and killing in the pages of the Old Testament is incontrovertible evidence that such activities have God 's blessing . .. Attitudes like this are terribly troubling to religious pacifists and demonstrate the kind of problems these texts create for them . Some modern-day pacifists such as Charles Raven have argued that the Church should repudiate the Old Testament as an unchristian book , thus echoing the approach taken by Marcion in the 2nd century . # Lex talionis # The meaning of the principle eye for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation . The exact Latin ( ' ' lex talionis ' ' ) to English translation of this phrase is actually The law of retaliation . At the root of this principle is that one of the purposes of the law is to provide equitable retribution for an offended party . The phrase an eye for an eye ( Hebrew ' ' ayin tachat ayin ' ' eye under eye ) is a quotation from several passages of the Hebrew Bible. ( , , and ) in which a person who has injured the eye of another is instructed to give the value of his or her own eye in compensation . It defined and restricted the extent of retribution in the laws of the Torah . The English word ' ' talion ' ' means a punishment identical to the offense , from the Latin ' ' talio ' ' . The principle of an eye for an eye is often referred to using the Latin phrase ' ' lex talionis ' ' , the law of talion . The expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Verses such as and which are sometimes rendered in Christian translations by an eye for an eye or similar have the expression ' ' ayin tachat ayin ' ' meaning each and every eye ( verbatim eye under eye ) in the original Hebrew . The verses where the expression occurs list situations for which fines are imposed to compensate injury and state that each and every injury must be compensated . The Talmud ( in ' ' Bava Kamma ' ' , 83b-84a ) , explicitly discusses the nature of this monetary compensation in tort cases and argues against the reinterpretation by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind , using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders . Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable , the phrase can not be interpreted in this manner but that , applying the same pragmatic revisionism , a similar value injury , such as losing a hand or foot could be inflicted if the offender did not have any eyes . Moreover , personal retribution is explicitly forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the social magistrate ( usually in the form of regional courts ) . # The Oral Law explains , based upon the biblical verses , that the Bible mandates a sophisticated five-part monetary form of compensation , consisting of payment for Damages , Pain , Medical Expenses , Incapacitation , and Mental Anguish which underlies many modern legal codes . Some rabbinic literature explains , moreover , that the expression , An eye for an eye , etc. suggests that the perpetrator deserves to lose his own eye , but that biblical law treats him leniently . Paraphrased from the Union of Orthodox Congregations , . # However , the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice , where the phrase ' ' ayin tachat ayin ' ' makes another appearance ( ) . Here , the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person . The Torah requires the court to do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother ( ) . Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria ( such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow , the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice ( including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty ) . Otherwise , the offenders receive lashes ( ' ' Makot ' ' 1:1 ; ibid. , Bab . Talmud 2a based on critical exegesis of ) . The Torah , as it exists today , clearly proscribes an eye for an eye whether in the context of revenge or compensation . However there seems to be is no such proscription for false witnesses who have colluded in a conspiracy . ( There is one case where the Torah states and you shall cut off her hand . The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner . This verse teaches that , although one must intervene to save the victim , one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury Sifrei ; Maimonides ' ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hil . ' ' Rotze'ach u'Sh'mirat Nefesh ' ' 1:7 . Regardless , there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye , tooth , or foot . ) Thus , it is impossible to read an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth literally in the context of a conspiratorial witness . discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court , where , under very limited circumstances , someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of redeemer of blood . In such cases , the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge . While the guilty party is there , the redeemer of blood may not kill him . If , however , the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile , the redeemer of blood , as an accessory of the court , may kill the guilty party . Nevertheless , the provision of the redeemer of blood does not serve as true reciprocal justice , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgoes his exile . Furthermore , intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus can not serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter , but as a penalty for escaping punishment ( ' ' Makot ' ' 7a13a ) . ( According to traditional Jewish Law , application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge , as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud . The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment . These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years . ) Christian interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the quotation from Leviticus ( 19:18 above ) in Jesus of Nazareth 's Sermon on the Mount . In the Expounding of the Law ( part of the Sermon on the Mount ) , Jesus urges his followers to turn the other cheek when confronted by violence : # You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . But I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . ( , NRSV ) # This saying of Jesus is frequently interpreted as criticism of the Old Testament teaching , and often taken as implying that an eye for an eye encourages excessive vengeance rather than an attempt to limit it . It was one of the points of ' fulfilment or destruction ' of the Hebrew law which the Church father St. Augustine already discussed in his Contra Faustum , Book XIX . As noted in previous sections , the natural tendency of people is for revenge and in the extreme . You hurt me or offended me so I am going to take an arm and a leg or sue you for all you have ! Although both the Hammurabi Code and Hebrew Law both had death penalties for many crimes , the eye for eye was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss ; in the hammurabi code as being literal , and in the Hebrew Law applying monetarily . Thus , it might be better read ' only one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guthridge cited many instances of genocide in the Old Testament : cquotethe Bible also contains the horrific account of what can only be described as a biblical holocaust . For , in order to keep the chosen people apart from and unaffected by the alien beliefs and practices of indigenous or neighbouring peoples , when God commanded his chosen people to conquer the Promised Land , he placed city after city ' under the ban -which meant that every man , woman and child was to be slaughtered at the point of the sword . Thus we read in the Book of Numbers that the Jews waged the campaign against Midian , as Yahweh had ordered Moses , and they put every male to death .. the sons of Israel took the Midianite women captive with their young children , and plundered all their cattle , all their flocks and all their goods . They set fire to the towns where they lived and all their encampments .. Then , when they took the captives , spoil and booty to Moses ... , Moses was enraged ... ' why have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill all the male children . Kill also all the women who have slept with a man . Spare the lives only of the young girls who have not slept with a man , and take them for yourselves . . Similarly in the Book of Deuteronomy , when the Jews attacked Sihon 's Amorite kingdom , Yahweh our God delivered him over to us .. We captured all his cities and laid whole towns under ban , men , women and children ; we spared nothing but the livestock which we took as our spoil . Likewise in the Transjordanian kingdom of Og , king of Bashan : We captured all his towns at that time .. Sixty towns .. We laid them under ban .. - the whole town , men , women and children , under the ban . . Sometimes , the ban could vary ; for in a later chapter of the same book , we read that if ( a town ) refuses peace and offers resistance , .. Yahweh your God shall deliver it unto your power and you are to put all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , the livestock and all that the town contains , all its spoil , you may take for yourselves as booty . . In the Book of Joshua , we read about the most famous case of all - the fall of Jericho : Then Yahweh said to Joshua , ' Now I am delivering Jericho and its king into your hands . So , when the walls of Jericho came tumbling down , the Jewish warriors enforced the ban on everything in the town : men and women , young and old , even the oxen and sheep and donkeys , massacring them all . The same for the people of Ai ( Bible ) The same in southern Canaan , which Yahweh gave into the power of Israel ; and Israel struck every living creature there with the edge of the sword , and left none alive . The Old Testament contains passages in which God commands the Israelites to exterminate seven Canaanite nations , and describes several wars of extermination that annihilated entire cities or groups of peoples . Examples include the story of Amalekites ( , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the Midianites ( ) , and the battle of Jericho ( ) . The extent of extermination is described in the scriptural passage which orders the Israelites to not leave alive anything that breathes completely destroy them . thus leading many scholars to characterize the exterminations as genocide . Niels Peter Lemche asserts that European colonialism in the nineteenth century was ideologically based on the Old Testament narratives of conquest and extermination . Arthur Grenke claims that the view or war expressed in Deuteronomy contributed to the destruction of Native Americans and to the destruction of European Jewry . # New Testament # Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa asserts that ' irenic ' and ' eristic ' tendencies ( i.e. peace and strife ) co-exist in the New Testament . Stroumsa cites the Sermon on the Mount ( , ) as an example of an irenic passage in the New Testament . As examples of eristic scriptures , Stroumsa cites the following Gospel passages : : Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ; I have But to bring a sword : I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already kindled ! Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ?

Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and Sell your cloak and buy a sword Other sayings and acts of Jesus that have been cited as examples of tacit acceptance of violence include : the absence of any censure of the soldier who asks Jesus to heal his servant , his cleansing of the Temple , and through his Apostles , baptising a Roman Centurion who is never asked to first give up arms . W.E . Addis cites the case of the soldiers instructed by in their duties by St. John the Baptist , and that of the military men whom Christ and His Apostles loved and familiarly conversed with ( , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unlawful , sufficiently prove the point . According to Steve Friesen , the apocalyptic Book of Revelation has been employed in a wide array of settings , many of which have been lethal . Among these , Friesen lists Christian hostility , Christian imperialism and Christian sectarian violence . There are also passages attributed to the ministry of Jesus used to support Christian pacifism , such as :
