The Mahal , are sometime pronounced Mandal , are a Jat gotra , now found mainly in Punjab , although few are still found in Jarauda in Muzaffarnagar District of Uttar Pradesh . They are one of the larger Muley Jat clans . # History and origin # The Mahal or Maahal are a tribe that originally came from Samana and settled in Karnal , in what is now Haryana . It acquired the name Mahal from an ancestor who was found newly born by his dead mother 's side . In the local dialect of Hindi and Urdu ( Haryanwi ) , marhi is a tomb or shrine . During the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam , a member of the tribe converted to Islam . In return , he was a granted an estate in Muzaffarnagar , Charthawal and Saron . In 1806 , after providing assistance to the British in the Anglo-Maratha wars , the family was granted a Jagir ( estate ) in Karnal . According to other traditions , they are descended from Yazdgerd III , the last Sassanian ruler of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prithvi Raj Chauhan , under a Malik Salahauddin . On the recommendation of the nawab of Samana , the Malik received a grant of a 100 villages ( referred to as mandal in the Hindi language ) , from Khanda Rao , a brother of Prithvi Raj . . In the time of the Sultan Alauddin Khilji , the Mahal received the jagirs of Samana and Malkana . The Mahal were in popular estimation , considered to a be a Mulla Jat tribe , and most members consider themselves to be Jats. # The Family of the Nawabs of Karnal # The most prominent Mahal family was that of the Nawabs of Karnal . They first appear in history in 1780 A , D , when the family was residing at Samana , Nawab Majid-ul-daula granted to Nawab Sher-ul-din Khan , their ancestor , the parganas of Muzaffarnagar , Shoran and Chitrawal in the Muzaffarnagar District on condition that he furnished for Government service 200 horsemen fully equipped ; on the death of the grantee in 1789 the grant was continued on the same terms to his brother Mahomdi Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his nephew Mahomed Ishaq and his cousin Ghairat AH Khan were in possession of these estates , and , in accordance with the policy of Lord Cornwalis , they were induced to accept a tract west of the Jumna in exchange . Thus the Mandals came to settle in Karnal . It is very doubtful whether Mr. Ibbetson 's idea of the Mandal descent is correct ; he has given no reasons , for his assertion and , beyond the fact that the Mandals follow some of the Jat customs , there appears to be no ground for believing them to belong to that tribe . On their seals the ancestors of the present Mandals called themselves Mandal-i-Nausherani , i.e. , the Mandal of the * ' Nausheranis , and we have to decide the meaning of this term . Nausherwan was a Persian King and Nausherwani chiefs have held sway at Kharan in Baluchistan since the 17th century . It appears from inquiries made there and from the Baluchistan Gazetteer that certain Nausherwan proceeded with Abdulla Khan of Kalat , when he accompanied Nadir Shah for the invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Nausherani family remained at Samana in possession of a tract which was then conquered , and that the present Mandals are descended from him . The meaning of the term ** Mandal as applied to this family is not certain ; in Shakespear 's dictionary the word , spelt with a hard ** d , is translated as a circle , halo ; a region , country ; a round tent ; an officer employed in villages , exciseman , while that spelt with a soft ** d is said to mean ** a kind of wooden drum ; a fountain . Ibbetson refers to ' * Mandila as meaning a plat- form on which guns are mounted . Of all these meanings the most probable is the exciseman or village officer , and it seems likely that an ancestor of the family was a Nausherwani who was left in charge of Samana or some other place during the raid of Nadir Shah in order to collect taxes there , that he was therefore called ' * Mandal-i-Nausherani , and that he and his successors managed to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adventurers and those who conquer and settle in foreign lands to adopt some of the customs of the people among whom they have come , and this would account for the Mandals following certain of the Jat customs . The fact that the affix Khan has been used by the family since they were first heard of in this neighbourhood , and that the first known member bore the title of Nawab , tends to support the theory that they formerly belonged to the Nausherani family of Baluchistan . Nawab Ahmad AH Khan , gave assisted the British authorities during the mutiny and for his services the quit-rent of Rs. 5,000 payable by him was remitted in perpetuity ; he was also presented with a khillat of Rs. 10,000 in Darbar and permitted to retain two cannon and one hundred armed retainers ; these honours have been continued to his suc- cessors . He died in 1867 and was succeeded by Azmat AH Khan , his eldest surviving son , who was given the title of Nawab Bahadur . Azmat AH Khan died childless in 1909 , and his half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nawab and the jagir , while he and his brother Muhammad Umar Daraz AH Khan inherited his estate . Before his death Azmat AH Khan , who was on bad terms with his half brothers , attempted to alienate his property , but it was brought under the Court of Wards and there is now litigation by the would-be donees to obtain possession thereof . For good services Rustam Ali Khan received the personal title of Nawab Bahadur and Umar Daraz AH Khan that of Khan Bahadur . The latter was also an Honorary Sub-Registrar , Munsif and Magistrate of the 1st class . Liaquat Ali Khan , the first Prime Minister of Pakistan , was the younger son of Rustam Ali Khan . The fact that the Samana branch spoke Punjabi , has historically created debates over the ethnic identity of Liaquat . Both the Karnal and Muzaffarnagar branches of the tribe spoke Urdu , as did other Mulla Jats. # Present situation # Presently , both the Samana and Karnal branches of the tribe emigrated to Pakistan , many are now found in the city of Punjab and Sindh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India .
