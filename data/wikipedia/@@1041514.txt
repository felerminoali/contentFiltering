nationality = Iranian Mohammad-Ali Jamlzdeh Esfahani ( ) ( January 13 , 1892 , Isfahan , Iran November 8 , 1997 , Geneva , Switzerland ) , was one of the most prominent writers of Iran in the 20th century , best known for his unique style of humour . In view of his vast influence over Persian short-story writing , he is often referred to as the father of this genre in Iran . # Biography # # Early years and family # Sayyed Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh , the founder of the Persian short-story genre , was born in Esfahan into a middle-class family . The date of his birth is uncertain ; years between 1892 to 1896 have been mentioned and , by the end of his life , even he himself was not certain of the actual year . The year 1895 has traditionally been taken as the year of his birth . Jamalzadeh 's father , Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani , was a progressive mullah and preacher who became a constitutional revolutionary , delivering raging sermons which inspired his son but cost him his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammad-Ali Shah Qajar who considered him among the most dangerous of his enemies . # Living abroad # The young Jamalzadeh lived in Iran only until he was twelve or thirteen . Thereafter , he lived in Lebanon , where he attended the Aintoura Catholic School ( 1908 ) near Beirut , in France ( 1910 ) , and in Switzerland where he studied law at University of Lausanne and later at University of Burgundy in Dijon , France . After his father 's death , Jamalzadeh 's life took a turn for the worse , but thanks to many supporting friends and to occasional paid teaching jobs , he survived starvation . By the time of World War I , still in his early age , he joined a group of Iranian nationalists in Berlin and , in 1915 , founded a newspaper ( ' ' Rastakhiz ' ' ) for this group in Baghdad . During this time he also worked for the periodical ' ' Kveh ' ' ( 1916 ) . In 1917 , he published his first book ' ' Ganj-e Shaye-gan ' ' ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the 20th century , ' ' Ganj-e Shaye-gan ' ' deals with Iran 's socio-political and economic problems , a major contribution which bridges the gap between literature and science . In the same year he represented the Nationalists at the World Congress of Socialists in Stockholm . His later years , until 1931 when he settled in Geneva and worked thereafter for the International Labour Organization , were spent in temporary employments , such as one at the Iranian embassy in Berlin . During all these years , Jamalzadeh had very little contact with Iran . But that did not bar him from learning Persian on his own . Drawing on his scant experiences gained at a young age , he wrote about the lives of contemporary Iranians . His preoccupation with the use of language and his Dickensian style of writing , including repetitions , piling up of adjectives , and using popular phrases , quickly remind the reader of Jamalzadeh 's background and of his sincere intentions . However , his physical distance from the scenes of the events described in his stories somewhat compromises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's major work ' ' Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud ' ' ( - Once Upon a Time ) , published in 1921 in Berlin , did not reach Iran until a year later , and when it did , it was not received favourably . The public , especially the clergy , loathed Jamalzadeh 's portrayal of their country to the degree that copies of the book were burned in public squares . A collection of six short stories , ' ' Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud ' ' deals with the social and political conditions in Iran around the start of the 20th century , a subject that up to then had been outside the purview of writers and poets in general . Moreover , interwoven with this is a considerable amount of militancy against Western interference in Iran and an open mockery of religious fanaticism . Jamalzadeh 's simple and colloquial style , combined with a measured humour , enhanced the impact of his writings , making his stories such as ' ' Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud ' ' and ' ' Farsi Shekar Ast ' ' ( Persian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . This hostile public reaction affected Jamalzadeh to the degree that for the next twenty years he refrained from engaging in any literary activities . He began writing again in the 1940s , but by that time he had lost the dexterity that imparted conciseness , novelty of form , originality of ideas , a biting sense of humor , and a tight structure to his earlier stories . Tautologism , a tendency toward using sage remarks , making mystical and philosophical speculations , and disregard for order became the hallmark of his later writings . ' ' Sahra-ye Mahshar ' ' ( Armageddon ) ( 1947 ) , ' ' Talkh-o Shirin ' ' ( Bitter and Sweet ) ( 1955 ) , ' ' Kohne va Now ' ' ( Old and New ) ( 1959 ) , ' ' Qair az Khoda Hichkas Nabud ' ' ( None Existed Except God ) ( 1961 ) , ' ' Asman-o Risman ' ' ( The Blue Yonder and Rope ) ( 1965 ) , ' ' Qesse-ha-ye Kutah Bara-ye Bachcheha-ye Rish-dar ' ' ( Short Stories for Bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Qesse-ye Ma be Akhar Rasid ' ' ( Thus Ends Our Story ) ( 1979 ) were written during this phase of his literary activity . Although Jamalzadeh continued to criticize the court and the clergy , some of his works of this period lack his original unique Persian style , even though he is at times as biting and as veracious as in his earlier writings . In addition to Persian , Jamalzadeh was fluent in French , German , and Arabic . He translated many books from the latter languages into Persian . # Death # Jamalzadeh died at the age of 105 , in Geneva , Switzerland . His tomb is located in the cemetery ( block number 22 ) . # Personal life # In 1914 Jamalzadeh married his first wife Josephine , a Swiss woman and a fellow student in Dijon . In 1931 and during his residence in Geneva , Jamalzadeh married his second wife , the German Margaret Eggert. # Bibliography # # Writings # * ' ' Shaygan 's Treasure ' ' ( 1916 ) * ' ' Iran and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud Yeki Nabud ' ' ( Once Upon a Time ) ( 1921 ) * ' ' Prosperity Garden ' ' ( 1938 ) * ' ' Sadi 's Councils ' ' ( 1938 ) * ' ' Lunatic Asylum ' ' ( 1941 ) * ' ' Story of Stories ' ' ( 1941 ) * ' ' Amo Hosseinali 's Biography ' ' ( 1942 ) * ' ' Qoltashan Collection ' ' ( 1946 ) * ' ' Gathering Desert ' ' ( 1947 ) * ' ' Rah-Ab Nameh ' ' ( 1947 ) * ' ' A Man with Thousand Professions ' ' ( 1947 ) * ' ' Masoumeh Shirazi ' ' play ( 1954 ) * ' ' Bitter and Sweet ' ' ( 1955 ) * ' ' Sar va Tah Yeh Karbas ' ' ( 1956 ) * ' ' Masterpiece ' ' ( 1958 ) * ' ' Pipe 's Voice ' ' ( 1958 ) * ' ' Old and New ' ' ( 1959 ) * ' ' Jamali 's Kashkoul ' ' ( 1960 ) * ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) * ' ' Seven Countries ' ' ( 1961 ) * ' ' Soil and Human ' ' ( 1961 ) * ' ' Vulgar Encyclopedia ' ' ( 1962 ) * ' ' Earth , Landlord and Peasant ' ' ( 1962 ) * ' ' Mysteries ' Small Box ' ' ( 1963 ) * ' ' Cock-and-Bull ' ' ( 1964 ) * ' ' Method of Writing and Story Writing ' ' ( 1966 ) * ' ' Shiraz and Humor of Us , Iranian ' ' ( 1966 ) * ' ' Short Stories for Bearded Children ' ' ( 1973 ) * ' ' Isfahan ' ' ( 1973 ) * ' ' Nightingale ' ' ( 1973 ) * ' ' Qanbar Ali , A Generous of Shiraz ' ' ( 1973 ) * ' ' Our Story is Finished ' ' ( 1978 ) * ' ' Familiar Democracy ' ' ( 1984 ) * ' ' Acquaintance with Hafiz Thesi ' ' s ( 1988 ) # Translation # * ' ' Le Caf du Surat ' ' by Bernardin de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mankind ' ' by Hendrik Willem van Loon ( 1955 ) * ' ' Wilhelm Tell ' ' by Friedrich Schiller ( 1956 ) * ' ' Don Carlos ' ' by Friedrich Schiller ( 1956 ) * ' ' Selected Stories ' ' by Molire ( 1957 ) * ' ' L'Avare ' ' by Molire ( 1957 ) * ' ' Democracy and Human Prestige ' ' ( 1959 ) * ' ' En Folkerfiende ' ' by Henrik Ibsen ( 1961 ) * ' ' Turkmen War ' ' by Conte de Gobineau ( 1973 ) # Further reading # * Mohammad Ali Jazayery , ' ' ' ' , Journal of the American Oriental Society , Vol. 90 , No. 2 , pp. 257 265 ( 1970 ) . * Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh , ' ' ' ' .
