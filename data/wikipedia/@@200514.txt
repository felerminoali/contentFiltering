deathplace = Affligem Abbey , Brabant Adeliza of Louvain , sometimes known in England as Adelicia of Louvain , also called Adela and Aleidis ; ( c. 1103 23 April 1151 ) was Queen of England from 1121 to 1135 , as the second wife of King Henry I. She was the daughter of Godfrey I , Count of Louvain. # Early life and family # Adeliza of Louvain was born in 1105 in Louvain , present-day Belgium . She was renowned for her beauty , reflected in the epithet the fair maiden of Brabant . The chronicler Henry of Huntingdon also mentions Adelizas beauty in an interlude in his Historia Anglorum stating , A jewel grows pale on you , a crown does not shine . Put adornment aside , for nature provides your adornment ... Her father was Godfrey I , Count of Louvain ( 1095-1139 ) , Landgrave of Brabant , and Duke of Lower Lotharingia ( 1106-1128 ) , an ally of Henry V , Holy Roman Emperor .

Adeliza 's brother , Joscelin of Louvain , married the heiress to the Percy fortune .

However , Henrys need for a new male heir expedited the marriage plans and the couple wed on 24 January 1121 . Apparently in addition to her beauty , Henry was also attracted to Adeliza as a wife because she was a descendant of Charlemagne . It is thought that Henrys only surviving legitimate child Empress Matilda , from his first wife Matilda of Scotland , may have been involved in arranging his second marriage , due to the fact that she was with him near the time that it was being negotiated .

Despite their close contact , however , Adeliza and Henry never produced a child . Unlike Henrys first wife Matilda , Adeliza appears to have played a very passive role in the administration of the kingdom . While Matilda issued some thirty-one charters and writs during her queenship , during Adeliza 's fifteen-year marriage to Henry I she issued one , and she only attested 13 of Henrys many charters , even though they were almost always together . # Role as artistic patron # Despite her limited involvement in politics , Adeliza seems to have played an active role as a patron of the arts and literature , and was influential in fostering the rise of French poetry in the English court . While English queens had been traditionally associated with artistic patronage for decades , and a number of them , including Edith of Wessex , Emma of Normandy and Matilda , had financed a number of works in different media , Adeliza primarily sponsored books written in French .

Many other works that Adeliza commissioned were similar in structure to the Bestiary , including the now lost Life of King Henry by David . # Widowhood and remarriage # When Henry died on 1 December 1135 , Adeliza retired temporarily to the Benedictine convent of Wilton Abbey , near Salisbury . She was present at the dedication of Henry 's tomb at Reading Abbey on the first anniversary of his death . At about that time , she founded a leper hospital dedicated to Saint Giles at Fugglestone St Peter , Wiltshire . In 1138 , three years after Henry I 's death , Adeliza married William d'Aubigny , 1st Earl of Arundel , one of Henry I 's advisors , and son of Guillaume dAubigny and Maud le Bigod .

After her second marriage , Adeliza received Matilda at her home in Arundel , along with Matildas half-brother Robert , 1st Earl of Gloucester , in defiance of the wishes of her husband who was a staunch supporter of King Stephen . She later betrayed them and handed them over when King Stephen besieged the castle . Trying to explain Adeliza 's actions , John of Worcester suggests that she feared the kings majesty and worried that she might lose the great estate she held throughout England . He also mentions Adelizas excuse to King Stephen , she swore on oath that his enemies had not come to England on her account but that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to her. # Landholdings # Because of Henry Is generosity , Adeliza was given the revenues of Rutland , Shropshire and a large district of London , with possession of the city of Chichester . Henry also gave the manor of Aston to Adeliza as his queen and wife . Landholdings that were part of Adeliza of Louvains dower include Waltham in Essex , an estate in south-east England , with areas in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire , Buckinghamshire , Berkshire , and Middlesex . She had property in Devon . As a gift from Henry I , she was given a property in Ashleworth , a component of the royal estate of Berkeley . In 1126 the whole county of Shropshire was given to her , even though it is not listed in the Pipe Roll . Adeliza gave her brother Joscelin a large estate in Sussex called Petworth that was dependent on her castle of Arundel .

In additions to those gifts , she was given a portion of the royal estate at Berkeley , and the county of Shropshire . After Matilda died , Adeliza continued to exercise jurisdiction over her lands , retaining some of her property until 1150 .

She added the gift of a church a few years later . # Later years # In the last years of her life , Adeliza appears to have faded into obscurity . In 1150 , Adeliza left William to enter the monastery of Afflighem in Flanders . At least one of her brothers was also living at this monastery .
