birthplace = Moscow , Russia deathplace = Moscow , Russia Michael I of Russia ( Russian : , ' ' Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov ' ' ) ( 12 July 1596 &amp;ndash ; 12 July 1645 ) was the first Russian Tsar of the house of Romanov . He was the son of Feodor Nikitich Romanov ( later known as Patriarch Filaret ) and Xenia ( later known as the ' ' great nun ' ' Martha ) . His reign marked the end of the Time of Troubles . # Life and reign # Michael 's grandfather , Nikita , was brother to the earlier Tsarina Anastasia and a central adviser to Ivan the Terrible . As a young boy , Michael and his mother had been exiled to Beloozero in 1600 . This was a result of the recently elected Tsar Boris Godunov , in 1598 , falsely accusing his father of treason . This may have been partly because Nikita had married Ksenia Shestova against Boris ' wishes . Michael was unanimously elected Tsar of Russia by a national assembly on 21 February 1613 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsar and his mother at the Ipatiev Monastery near Kostroma until 24 March . He had been chosen after several other options had been removed , including royalty of Poland and Sweden . Michael was partly chosen for his connection by distant relation to the earlier Tsarina Anastasia , the wife of Ivan IV . Initially , Martha protested , believing and stating that her son was too young and tender for so difficult an office , and in such a troublesome time . The weeping boyars solemnly declared that if he persisted in his refusal , they would hold him responsible to God for the destruction of Russia . Michael eventually consented to accept the throne . Michael 's election and accession to the throne form the basis of the Ivan Susanin legend , which Russian composer Mikhail Glinka dramatized in his opera ' ' A Life for the Tsar ' ' . In so dilapidated a condition was the capital at this time that Michael had to wait for several weeks at the Troitsa monastery , 75 mi off , before decent accommodation could be provided for him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first task of the new tsar was to clear the land of the countries occupying it . Sweden and Poland were then dealt with respectively by the peace of Stolbovo ( 17 February 1617 ) and the Truce of Deulino ( 1 December 1618 ) . The most important result of the Truce of Deulino was the return from exile of the tsar 's father , who henceforth took over the government till his death in October 1633 , Michael occupying quite a subordinate position . Tsar Michael suffered from a progressing leg injury ( a consequence of a horse accident early in his life ) , which resulted in his not being able to walk towards the end of his life . He was a gentle and pious prince who gave little trouble to anyone and effaced himself behind his counsellors . Sometimes they were relatively honest and capable men like his father ; sometimes they were corrupted and bigoted , like the Saltykov relatives of his mother . He was married twice , first to Princess Maria Vladimirovna Dolgorukova in 1624 , who died four months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eudoxia Streshneva ( 1608&amp;ndash ; 1645 ) , who brought him 10 children . Michael 's failure to wed his daughter Irene of Russia with Count Valdemar Christian of Schleswig-Holstein , a morganatic son of King Christian IV of Denmark , in consequence of the refusal of the latter to accept Orthodoxy , so deeply afflicted him as to contribute to bringing about his death on 12 July 1645. # Michael 's governments # The two most important politically government offices ( prikazes ) were Posolsky Prikaz ( Foreign Office ) and Razryadny Prikaz ( a Duma chancellery and a personnel department for both central and provincial administration including military command ) . Those offices could be pivotal in struggles between Boyar factions , so they were traditionally headed not by Boyars but by dyak ( professional clerks ) . The first head of the Posolsky Prikaz under Michael was Pyotr Tretyakov until his death in 1618 ; he conducted policy of allying with Sweden against Poland . The next one , Ivan Gramotin had a reputation of a Poloniphile ; this appointment was necessary to bring forth Filaret 's release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Poland ; Gramotin fell in his disfavour and was fired and exiled in 1626 . The same fate was shared by Efim Telepnev in 1630 and Fedor Likhachov in 1631 - they too tried to soothe Filaret 's belligerent approach . Ivan Gryazev , appointed in 1632 , was promoted from second ranks of bureaucracy to fulfill Filaret 's orders . After Filaret 's and Gryazev 's deaths the post was once again assumed by Gramotin in 1634 , and after the latter 's retirement in 1635 , by Likhachov , with general course on pacification . Razryadny Prikaz was first headed by Sydavny Vasilyev ; Filaret replaced him by his fellow in captivity Tomilo Lugovskoy , but the latter somehow caused Filaret 's anger and was exiled . In 1623 Fedor Likhachov was made head of Prikaz till his shift to Posolsky Prikaz , and in 1630 Razryad was given to Ivan Gavrenev , an outstanding administrator who took up this post for 30 years . Three other strategic offices were Streletsky Prikaz ( in charge of streltsy regiments who served as Moscow garrison ) , Treasury ( Prikaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact ministry of health , most particularly the tsar 's health ) . After Filaret 's arrival their former heads were sent away from Moscow , and all three given to Ivan Cherkassky ( Filaret 's nephew ) , who proved to be an able and competent administrator and was a de facto prime minister till his death in 1642 . Fedor Sheremetev who had succeeded to all Cherkassky 's posts was a rather weak figure ; the real power was in the hands of a court marshal , Alexey Lvov. # Issue # From his marriage to Eudoxia Streshneva , Michael fathered 10 children : border= 1 style= border-collapse : collapse ; !
