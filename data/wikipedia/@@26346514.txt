commander1=Commodore Horatio Nelson Lieutenant Thomas Hardy The Action of 19 December of 1796 was a minor naval engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars , fought off the coast of Murcia between a small squadron of two British frigates under Commodore Horatio Nelson and a small squadron of two Spanish frigates under Commodore Don Jacobo Stuart , who was descendent of the British royal house of Stuart . Nelson managed to capture one of the Spanish frigates , but the unexpected appearance of superior Spanish forces forced him to withdraw hurriedly abandoning his prize . # Background # By October of 1796 , the Genoese position in Corsica and the continued French advances led the British to decide that the Mediterranean fleet could no longer be supplied and they ordered it to be evacuated to Gibraltar . Commodore Nelson was then required to cover the evacuation of the British garrison at the island of Elba . He was sailing from Gibraltar to there aboard the frigate ' ' HMS Minerve ' ' of 42 guns , under by Captain George Cockburn , accompanied by the frigate ' ' HMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dArcy Preston in substitution of Charles Sawyer , court-martialled for homosexuality , when at 10 pm of December 19 two Spanish frigates were sighted cruising off Cartagena .

The ' ' Minerve ' ' engaged the ' ' Sabina ' ' while the ' ' Blanche ' ' , agreeably to Nelson 's directions , began a persecution of the ' ' Matilde ' ' , keeping off the action . The ' ' Sabina ' ' struck her colours after a hard resistance of three hours which was later praised by Nelson in his official letter about the combat .

After half an hour the ' ' Matilde ' ' retreated damaged , but three other Spanish ships , the ' ' Prncipe de Asturias ' ' of 112 guns , and the frigates ' ' Ceres ' ' of 40 , and ' ' Perla ' ' of 34 guns , hove in sight .
