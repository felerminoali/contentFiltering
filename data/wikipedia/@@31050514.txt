The score earned Powell his first Academy Award nomination and his third BAFTA nomination , which he lost to ' ' The Social Network ' ' and ' ' The King 's Speech ' ' , respectively . The score also won the International Film Music Critics Association 2011 Awards for Best Original Score for an Animated Feature and Film Score of the Year , and was nominated twice for Film Music Composition of the Year for the tracks Forbidden Friendship and Test Drive . # Background # ' ' How to Train Your Dragon ' ' was composer John Powell 's sixth collaboration with DreamWorks Animation . Powell had scored many of DreamWorks ' previous films , but this was the first of DreamWorks ' films where Powell helmed the score on his own ( on his previous efforts with DreamWorks , he had collaborated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Zimmer had long praised Powell 's abilities , and on many occasions , asserted that he was the superior composer between them , thus firmly supporting Powell 's first solo animation effort . For the score , Powell utilized many Celtic influences , employing instruments like the fiddle , bagpipes , dulcimer , pennywhistle , and even a harpsichord . Icelandic singer Jnsi was brought on to write and record the song Sticks &amp; Stones , which plays during the end credits of the film . In an interview with ' ' The Wrap s Steve Pond , Powell talked about his intent for the score : I was certainly trying to get a bit more epic . I just felt the animation and the visuals were giving me a broader palette to play with . As a kid I remember watching ' ' The Vikings ' ' with Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas , and I always liked that score . The directors were really very specific a lot of the time . They did want size and depth and emotion . They wanted a feeling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was Nielson , the Danish symphonist . Sibelius .

So that , plus it was great to have Jnsi do a song at the end of the movie , because I 've always liked moody Icelandic band Sigur Rs . They were an influence as well , even though that seems paradoxical . But there is that in a few cuesheavy , dark guitar textures going on at the same time as large orchestration . We looked at all the folk music from the Nordic areas . And I 'm part Scottish and grew up with a lot of Scottish folk music , so that came into it a lot .

Christian Clemmensen , founder of ' ' Filmtracks.com ' ' and member of the IFMCA , praised the score , saying that Powell has finally managed to create a well rounded and more easily digestible variation on his typical mannerisms for ' ' How to Train Your Dragon ' ' . He however criticized the use of Scottish and Irish tones in a score meant for Vikings , as well as the Jnsi song Sticks &amp; Stones , which he felt drained all the enthusiasm out of the environment created by Powell . However , Clemmensen still awarded the score the highest rating of five stars , and later listed the score as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed similar opinions about the score . Jonathan Broxton , founder of and another member of the IFMCA said : Its very rare that one can listen to an entire 70+ minute album and honestly say that all of them have musical merit , but that is genuinely the case here . Usually scores of this length have a fair amount of filler , but on ' ' How to Train Your Dragon ' ' every cue has worth . Archie Watt from ' ' MovieCues ' ' said : I sincerely hope that Powells work will be rewarded with an Oscar in 2011 . It couldnt be more deservedthe score is by far the best of the year to date , and I cant foresee any other score taking that accolade from this masterpiece . Both reviewers named it as the Best Score of the Year . # Awards and nominations # # Track listing # # References #
