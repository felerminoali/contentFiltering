An all-weather running track is a rubberized artificial running surface for track and field athletics . It provides a consistent surface for competitors to test their athletic ability unencumbered by adverse weather conditions . Historically , various forms of dirt , grass , sand and crushed cinders were used . Many examples of these varieties of track still exist worldwide . # Measurement of a track # The proper length for a competitive running track is 400mft 1 . Some tracks are not built to this specification , instead some are legacy to imperial distances like 440ydm 1 . Prior to rule changes in 1979 , imperial distances were still used in the United States . Some facilities build tracks to fit the available space . Olympic tracks in the early 20th century were of other lengths . Each lane of the track could ( by IAAF rules should ) be as wide as 122cmft 2 , though the majority of American tracks are built to NFHS high school specifications that allow smaller lanes . The IAAF also specifies a preferred radius for the turns at 37 metres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conducted and world records are allowed to be set on tracks that are not exactly 37 metres , but do fall in the range . # History # Starting in the late 1950s , artificial surfaces using a combination of rubber and asphalt began to appear . An artificial warm up track was constructed for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne , Australia . During the 1960s many of these tracks were constructed , examples still exist today . Their survival are a testament to the durability and inconsistency of these early attempts . In the mid-1960s Tartan tracks , surfaced with a product by 3M . The name Tartan is a trademark , but many have misused it as a genericized trademark . This process was the first to commercialize a polyurethane surface for running tracks , though originally conceived for horse racing . Many Tartan tracks were installed worldwide including at many of the top Universities in the United States . Among that list was a Tartan track installed in the Estadio Olmpico Universitario , home of the 1968 Summer Olympics at Mexico City which were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putt champion Bill Nieder was instrumental in developing the product and selling it for this first use in the Olympics . An all-weather surface has become standard ever since . Another Tartan track was installed on a temporary basis for the 1968 United States Olympic Trials held at altitude at Echo Summit , California , before being moved to South Tahoe Middle School , where it survived for almost 40 years . An original Tartan track is still in place ( though horribly mistreated ) at Speed City San Jose State University on a satellite to the campus at 10th Street and Alma . Years of the abuse of tractors tearing it and cars parked on it shows the durability of this original product . Surfacing tracks has become an industry with many competitors . * Tartan ; The legacy of the brand is now known as Tartan APS * Chevron 440 ; was a popular surface of the mid-1970s * Rekortan ; was invented and used for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , Germany and is still licensed Worldwide * Eurotan * Martin ISS was another 1970 's development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Plexitracs and there are other techniques that distribute small chunks of rubber then adhere them in place with various Polyurethane or latex substances . The International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , international governing body of the sport , publishes very specific regulations for the conduct of a Global Championship or International level track meet ( which is their jurisdiction of the sport ) . Since its inception in the early-1980s , the manufacturer of the surfaces selected for most championship meets has been by the Italian company , Mondo , again the trademarked brand name becoming misused as a genericized trademark . Mondo surfaces differ in that they are more of a rubber carpet , cut to size then tightly seamed together ( in the linear direction along the lane lines ) . This form of construction gives a more consistent bounce ( or energy return ) and traction . Because of the tight fit specifications required for manufacture , construction surrounding these sites also has to be of a higher standard , making Mondo also one of the most expensive systems to use . Examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , United Kingdom , 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China , 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece and 1996 Summer Olympics ( since removed from the Centennial Olympic Stadium ) in Atlanta , Georgia , USA and record setting locations King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels , Belgium . Estdio Olmpico Joo Havelange , the future home of the 2016 Summer Olympics also has a Mondo surface . Another player in the marketplace is BASF owned Conica , which can boast the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin , Germany ( where Usain Bolt improved his 100 meters and 200 meters world records ) , along with other record hosting venues like Stadio Olimpico in Rome , Italy
