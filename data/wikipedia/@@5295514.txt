narrator = Orson Welles runtime = 116 minutes ' ' The Vikings ' ' is a 1958 adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer and filmed in Technicolor . It was produced by and stars Kirk Douglas . It is based on the novel ' ' The Viking ' ' by Edison Marshall , which in turn is based on material from the sagas of Ragnar Lodbrok and his sons . Other starring roles were taken by Tony Curtis , Janet Leigh and Ernest Borgnine . The film made notable use of natural locations in Norway . It was mostly filmed in Maurangerfjorden and Maurangsnes , captured on film by cinematographer Jack Cardiff although Aella 's castle was the real Fort de la Latte in north-east Brittany . Despite being derisively called a Norse Opera by ' ' New York Times ' ' critic Bosley Crowther , the film proved a major box office success and spawned the television series ' ' Tales of the Vikings ' ' , directed by the film 's editor , Elmo Williams , which included none of the original cast or characters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Viking raid led by the fearsome Ragnar ( Ernest Borgnine ) . Because the king had died childless , his cousin Aella ( Frank Thring ) takes the throne . The king 's widow , however , is pregnant with what she knows is Ragnar 's child because he had ravished her during that fateful raid , and to protect the infant from her cousin-in-law 's ambitions , she sends him off to Italy . By a twist of fate , the ship is intercepted by the Vikings , who are unaware of the child 's kinship , and enslave him . The boy grows into a young man named Erik ( Tony Curtis ) . His parentage is finally discovered by Lord Egbert ( James Donald ) , a Northumbrian nobleman opposed to Aella . When Aella accuses him of treason , Egbert finds sanctuary with Ragnar in Norway . Egbert recognises the Northumbrian royal sword 's pommel stone on an amulet around Erik 's neck , placed there by Erik 's mother when he was a child , but tells no one . Erik incurs the wrath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate son and heir , after the former orders his falcon to attack Einar , taking out one of his eyes . Erik is saved from immediate execution when the tribal shaman Kitala ( who loves Erik as a son ) says that Odin will curse whoever kills him . He is left in a tidal pool to drown with the rising tide by Ragnar 's decree to avoid the curse , but after Erik calls out to Odin , the wind shifts and forces the water away , saving him . Egbert then claims him as his slave . Egbert hopes to find an opportunity to take advantage of Erik 's unknown claim to the Northumbrian kingdom . The enmity between Erik and Einar is exacerbated when they both fall in love with Princess Morgana ( Janet Leigh ) , who was to marry King Aella but is captured in a raid suggested by Egbert . During a drunken feast in the great hall , complete with giant mead caldrons and an axe-throwing competition , Einar confesses his feelings to Ragnar , who tells Einar he can have Morgana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on , and begins to ravish her defying his expectations of resistance , she submits to him , her emotions towards Einar clearly divided between attraction and revulsion . But before things can go any further , Erik grabs Einar from behind and knocks him out , then takes Morgana away on a small ship he had constructed for Egbert . Erik and Morgana flee to England , along with Sandpiper ( Erik 's friend and fellow slave ) , Kitala and Morgana 's maid Bridget ( Dandy Nichols ) . Einar regains consciousness and gives the alarm , and several pursuing longships quickly gain on the fugitives . In thick fog , Ragnar 's longship hits a rock and sinks , while Erik 's boat is guided safely by a primitive compass , a piece of magnetite in the shape of a fish that Sandpiper obtained in a distant land . Einar , in another longship , believes Ragnar to be dead and grudgingly abandons the chase . Ragnar , however , is rescued by Erik and taken prisoner to Aella . Erik and Morgana become lovers during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge to marry Aella . Aella orders the Viking leader bound and thrown into a pit filled with starved wolves . To give Ragnar a Viking 's death ( so that he can enter Valhalla ) , Erik , who is granted the honour of forcing him into the pit , cuts the prisoner 's bonds and gives him his sword . Laughing , Ragnar jumps to his death . In response to Erik 's ' ' treason ' ' , Aella cuts off his left hand , puts him back on his ship and casts him adrift . Erik returns to Einar 's settlement , and tells his half-brother how his father died , and what had been Aella 's reward for allowing Ragnar to die a Viking 's death . With this revelation , and the promise that Erik will guide their ships through the fog ( thus making a surprise attack possible ) , Einar is finally able to persuade the other Vikings to mount an invasion of Northumbria . Putting their mutual hatred aside for the moment , Einar and Erik sail for England . The dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . The alarm is sounded and the terrified peasants abandon their fields and flocks and flee to take refuge within the castle . Soon the Vikings are arrayed in front of the fortress in full battle armour . Shouting the name of ' ' Odin ! ' ' , the Vikings storm Aella 's castle . In a bold move , Einar has several Vikings throw axes at the closed drawbridge that bars entrance to the castle 's keep . Several of the axe-throwers are killed , but enough survive to throw their axes that a ladder is created for Einar to climb after he leaps across the moat to the drawbridge . He gains entry to the keep and lowers the drawbridge so that the other Vikings can overwhelm the outnumbered English . Erik and Einar both set off in search of Morgana . Erik encounters Aella instead and shoves him into the wolf pit . Einar finds Morgana in the highest tower of the keep , and again begins to make love to her , telling her she will be his Queen . In spite of her still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and loves Erik . Enraged , Einar drags her outside and calls Erik to their long-delayed battle . The two bitter rivals engage in a swordfight on top of the tower . Erik is defeated , his sword broken , but as Einar prepares to deliver the killing blow , he hesitates , having learned the truth from Morgana , and suddenly seeing Ragnar in Erik 's defiant face . This gives Erik ( who does not yet know they are brothers ) the opportunity to fatally stab Einar with his sword 's broken blade . Echoing the scene with Ragnar , Erik gives Einar a sword , so that he too can enter Valhalla . In the final scene , Einar is given a Viking funeral : his body is placed on a longship , which is set on fire by flaming arrows . # Cast # * Kirk Douglas as Einar * Tony Curtis as Erik * Ernest Borgnine as Ragnar Lodbrok * Janet Leigh as Morgana * James Donald as Ecgberht I of Northumbria * Alexander Knox as Father Godwin * Maxine Audley as Enid * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitala * Edric Connor as Sandpiper * Dandy Nichols as Bridget * Per Buckhj as Bjrn Ironside * Orson Welles as The Narrator # Casting # Ernest Borgnine plays Ragnar , the father of Einar , played by Kirk Douglas .
