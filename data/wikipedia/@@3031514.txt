Janus Dousa ( Latinized from Jan van der Does ) , Lord of Noordwyck ( 6 December 1545 8 October 1604 ) , was a Dutch statesman , jurist , historian , poet and philologist , and the first Librarian of Leiden University Library . # Biography # He was born at Noordwijk , in the province of Holland . Dousa 's parents , Johan van der Does , lord of Noordwijk , and Anna van Nijenrode died when their son was only five years old . Dousa was placed under the guardianship of his grandfather Frans van Nijenrode until his death in 1560 and later of his uncle Werner van der Does , lord of Kattendijke . He began his studies at Lier in Brabant , became a pupil of Henry Junius at Delft in 1560 , and then passed on in succession to Louvain , Douai and Paris . Here he studied Greek under Jean Dorat , professor at the College Royal , and became acquainted with the chancellor L'Hopital , Adrianus Turnebus , Pierre de Ronsard and other eminent men . On his return in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the lower nobility . From his father he inherited the lordship of Noordwijk , from his uncle Werner the lordship of Kattendijke . He returned to his estates in 1566 , the year of the iconoclastic fury , when the Low Countries were on the threshold of a new period in their history : the Dutch Revolt . He was not , however , at first very eager to commit himself to the fortunes of William the Silent , Prince of Orange , but having once chosen his side , he threw himself heart and soul into the struggle for freedom from the Spanish yoke . In his lordships Dousa adopted a moderate policy of religious tolerance : both Catholicism and Protestantism were allowed . As a member of the nobility he joined the Verbond der Edelen , the confederation of noblemen against the religious policy of Philip II of Spain . In 1570 he became hoogheemraad ( inspector of the dikes ) and a member of the States of Holland on behalf of the nobility . When in 1572 the Revolt formally began with the first independent meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year he participated in an embassy to queen Elizabeth I of England to ask for support against Spain . Fortunately for Leiden , he was residing in the town at the time of the famous siege . He held no post in the government , but in the hour of need he , though not trained to arms , took the command of a company of troops . His own resolution encouraged the regents and citizens to prolong the defense . On the foundation of the Leiden University by William the Silent , Dousa was appointed first curator , and he held this office for nearly thirty years . Through his friendships with foreign scholars , he drew to Leiden many illustrious teachers and professors . After the assassination of the Prince of Orange in 1584 , Dousa undertook a private journey to England to try and persuade Queen Elizabeth to support the cause of the states , and in 1585 he went at the head of a formal embassy for the same purpose . She refused to accept the sovereignty of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , but she was willing to send Robert Dudley , earl of Leicester , with a small army , to lend support . About the same time Dousa was appointed keeper of the archive of Holland ( registermeester van Holland ) , and the opportunities thus afforded him of historical research he turned to good account . In 1591 he was appointed a justice in the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland which he remained till his death . He died at Noordwijk and was interred at the Hague ; but no monument was erected to his memory until 1792 , when one of his descendants placed a tomb to his honour in the church of Noordwyck . There are good portraits of the Great Dousa , as he is often called , by Visscher and Houbraken. # Family # He had twelve children , but only nine of them , seven sons and two daughters , reached adult age . All his sons acquired a reputation for learning , especially Janus Dousa Filius ( ' the son ' ) , but he died in 1596 at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1569 Dousa published his first collection of poems ( epigrams , satires , elegies , etc . ) . A new collection appeared in 1575 . This collection contains ( among other poems ) five ' ' Odae Lugdunenses ' ' on the siege of Leiden . In 1584 a volume of epodes was issued . In 1585 Dousa wrote the ' ' Odae Britannicae ' ' . 1586 saw the release of a new book of elegies . In 1599 and 1601 Dousas historiographical works appeared . In 1603 a poetic volume called ' ' Echo ' ' and a collection of three odes was released . Some more works were issued posthumously . Apart from these literary works Dousa published collections of text-critical remarks on and editions of classical authors : Sallust , Horace , Catullus , Tibullus , Petronius , Plautus , Propertius , Lucilius . Dousas historiographical labour is especially relevant . In 1585 , when Dousa was 40 years old , he became the first Librarian at Leiden University Library with a special commission to write a history of Holland . At that moment however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one is to trust Heinsius eulogy , Dousa had been studying history since the moment he returned from France . Letters from the years 1582 and 1583 prove that Dousa had at least been deepening his knowledge of the history of Holland since 1577 . In the letter from 1582 one even comes across a specimen of his ' ' Annales ' ' written in hexameters . In 1584 Dousa edited the work of Adrianus Barlandus , a historiographer from Zeeland . His first accomplishment after his commission in 1585 was the posthumous publication of the work of Hadrianus Junius in 1588 . However , his political activities prevented him from finishing his own history within a few years . In 1593 two ' ' Epistulae apologeticae ' ' were published in which Dousa apologized for the fact that the commissioned work had still not appeared . However , the States of Holland had to wait for their history still longer when Dousas eldest son died in 1597 . Sorrow kept Dousa from finishing his work until 1599 . In this year the metrical ' ' Annales ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Bataviae Hollandiaeque Annales ' ' ) was published in 1601 . Dousa was rewarded by the States of Holland with a golden chain , a medal , and exemption from the obligation to appear in the Supreme Court . In 1604 Dousa intended to edit the works of the historians Johannes de Beka and Willem Heda , but on October 8 of the same year he died of the plague before he was able to realize this plan . * ' ' Jani Dousae filii Poemata ' ' . - Roterodami : apud Adrianum van Dijk , 1704.
