Green anarchism or eco-anarchism , is a school of thought within anarchism which puts a particular emphasis on environmental issues . An important early influence was the thought of the American anarchist Henry David Thoreau and his book ' ' Walden ' ' as well as Leo Tolstoy and lise Reclus . In the late 19th century there emerged anarcho-naturism as the fusion of anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in France , Spain , Cuba and Portugal . Important contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology . # Early ecoanarchism # # Henry David Thoreau # Anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of American anarchist and transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau . In his book ' ' Walden ' ' he advocates simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization . The work is part personal declaration of independence , social experiment , voyage of spiritual discovery , satire , and manual for self-reliance . First published in 1854 , it details Thoreau 's experiences over the course of two years , two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walden Pond , amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson , near Concord , Massachusetts . The book compresses the time into a single calendar year and uses passages of four seasons to symbolize human development . By immersing himself in nature , Thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through personal introspection . Simple living and self-sufficiency were Thoreau 's other goals , and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy , a central theme of the American Romantic Period . As Thoreau made clear in his book , his cabin was not in wilderness but at the edge of town , about two miles ( 3 km ) from his family home . A such Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan . For George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid XIX century . John Zerzan himself included the text Excursions ( 1863 ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against civilization : Readings and reflections ' ' from 1999. # lise Reclus # lise Reclus ( 15 March 1830 4 July 1905 ) , also known as Jacques lise Reclus , was a renowned French geographer , writer and anarchist . He produced his 19-volume masterwork ' ' La Nouvelle Gographie universelle , la terre et les hommes ' ' ( Universal Geography ) , over a period of nearly 20 years ( 18751894 ) . In 1892 he was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal of the Paris Geographical Society for this work , despite his having been banished from France because of his political activism . According to Kirkpatrick Sale : For the authors of An Anarchist FAQ Reclus argued that a secret harmony exists between the earth and the people whom it nourishes , and when imprudent societies let themselves violate this harmony , they always end up regretting it . Similarly , no contemporary ecologist would disagree with his comments that the truly civilised man and women understands that his or her nature is bound up with the interest of all and with that of nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and works to improve his domain . Reclus advocated nature conservation and opposed meat-eating and cruelty to animals . He was a vegetarian . As a result , his ideas are seen by some historians as anticipating the modern social ecology and animal rights movements . Shortly before his death , Reclus completed ' ' L'Homme et la terre ' ' ( 1905 ) . In it , he added to his previous greater works by considering humanity 's development relative to its geographical environment . Reclus was also an early proponent of naturism. # Anarcho-naturism # In the late 19th century Anarchist naturism appeared as the union of anarchist and naturist philosophies . Mainly it had importance within individualist anarchist circles in Spain , France , Portugal , and Cuba . Anarcho-naturism advocated vegetarianism , free love , nudism and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them . Anarcho-naturism promoted an ecological worldview , small ecovillages , and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity . Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological , physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Important promoters of this were Henri Zisly and Emile Gravelle who collaborated in ' ' La Nouvelle Humanit ' ' followed by ' ' Le Naturien ' ' , ' ' Le Sauvage ' ' , ' ' L'Ordre Naturel ' ' , &amp; ' ' La Vie Naturelle ' ' # # France # # Richard D. Sonn comments on the influence of naturist views in the wider French anarchist movement : Zisly 's political activity , primarily aimed at supporting a return to ' natural life ' through writing and practical involvement , stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment . Zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization , which he regarded as ' absurd , ignoble , and filthy . ' He openly opposed industrialization , arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian , defended nudism , advocated a non-dogmatic and non-religious adherence to the ' laws of nature , ' recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self-sufficiency , and disagreed with vegetarianism , which he considered ' anti-scientific. ' # # Cuba # # The historian Kirwin R. Schaffer in his study of Cuban anarchism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchist movement alongside anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism . Naturism was a global alternative health and lifestyle movement . Naturists focused on redefining one 's life to live simply , eat cheap but nutritious vegetarian diets , and raise one 's own food if possible . The countryside was posited as a romantic alternative to urban living , and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the healthful benefits of nudism . Globally , the naturist movement counted anarchists , liberals , and socialists as its followers . However , in Cuba a particular anarchist dimension evolved led by people like Adrin del Valle , who spearheaded the Cuban effort to shift naturism 's focus away from only individual health to naturism having a social emancipatory function . Schaffer reports the influence that anarcho-naturism had outside naturists circles . So For instance , nothing inherently prevented an anarcho-syndicalist in the Havana restaurant workers ' union from supporting the alternative health care programs of the anarcho-naturists and seeing those alternative practices as revolutionary . . Anarcho-naturists promoted a rural ideal , simple living , and being in harmony with Nature as ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides promoting an early twentieth-century back-to-the-land movement , they used these romantic images of Nature to illustrate how far removed a capitalist industrialized Cuba had departed from an anarchist view of natural harmony . The main propagandizer in Cuba of anarcho-naturism was the Catalonia born Adrin del Valle ( aka Palmiro de Lidia ) ... Over the following decades , Del Valle became a constant presence in not only the anarchist press that proliferated in Cuba but also mainstream literary publications ... From 1912 to 1913 he edited the freethinking journal ' ' El Audaz ' ' . Then he began his largest publishing job by helping to found and edit the monthly alternative health magazine that followed the anarcho-naturist line ' ' Pro-Vida ' ' . # # Spain # # Anarcho-naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in the spanish anarchist movement In France , later important propagandists of anarcho-naturism include Henri Zisly and mile Gravelle whose ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in Spain , where Federico Urales ( pseudonym of Joan Montseny ) promoted the ideas of Gravelle and Zisly in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation , in July 1928 , and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress , in September 1929 , both supported by the Libertarian Movement . However , in the short term , the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life . The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner ( real name of Han Ryner ) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI , ( Federacin Anarquista Ibrica ) . This ecological tendency in Spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the CNTFAI in Spain . Daniel Gurin in ' ' Anarchism : From Theory to Practice ' ' reports : # # Isaac Puente # # Isaac Puente was an influential Spanish anarchist during the 1920s and 1930s and an important propagandist of anarcho-naturism , was a militant of both the CNT anarcho-syndicalist trade union and Iberian Anarchist Federation . He published the book ' ' El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims ' ' ) in 1933 , which sold around 100,000 copies , and wrote the final document for the Extraordinary Confederal Congress of Zaragoza of 1936 which established the main political line for the CNT for that year . Puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view . He saw naturism as an integral solution for the working classes , alongside Neo-Malthusianism , and believed it concerned the living being while anarchism addressed the social being . He believed capitalist societies endangered the well-being of humans from both a socioeconomic and sanitary viewpoint , and promoted anarcho-communism alongside naturism as a solution . # # Other countries # # Naturism also met anarchism in the United Kingdom . In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900s nudism , anarchism , vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life . In the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway , near Stroud in Gloucestershire , shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian Anarchist Federation in Carrara in 1965 , a group decided to split off from this organization and created the ' ' Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica ' ' . In the seventies , it was mostly composed of veteran individualist anarchists with an orientation of pacifism , naturism , etc , .. . American anarcho-syndicalist Sam Dolgoff shows some of the criticism that some people on the other anarchist currents at the time had for anarcho-naturist tendencies . Speaking of life at the Stelton Colony of New York in the 1930s , noted with disdain that it , like other colonies , was infested by vegetarians , naturists , nudists , and other cultists , who sidetracked true anarchist goals . One resident always went barefoot , ate raw food , mostly nuts and raisins , and refused to use a tractor , being opposed to machinery , and he did n't want to abuse horses , so he dug the earth himself . Such self-proclaimed anarchists were in reality ox-cart anarchists , Dolgoff said , who opposed organization and wanted to return to a simpler life . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumbled , I am sick and tired of these half-assed artists and poets who object to organization and want only to play with their belly buttons . . # Leo Tolstoy and tolstoyanism # Russian christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist Leo Tolstoy is also recognized as an early influence in green anarchism . The novelist was struck by the description of Christian , Buddhist , and Hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness . After reading passages such as the following , which abound in Schopenhauer 's ethical chapters , the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will : # ' ' But this very necessity of involuntary suffering ( by poor people ) for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ( Matthew 19:24 ) : It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . Therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation , chose voluntary poverty when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but voluntarily took to the mendicant 's staff ; and Francis of Assisi , the founder of the mendicant orders who , as a youngster at a ball , where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together , was asked : Now Francis , will you not soon make your choice from these beauties ? and who replied : I have made a far more beautiful choice ! Whom ? ' ' La poverta ' ' ( poverty ) : whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant . ' ' # Despite his misgivings about anarchist violence , Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in Russia , and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin 's Words of a Rebel , illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906 . Tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of Henry George , incorporating it approvingly into later works such as ' ' Resurrection ' ' , the book that played a major factor in his excommunication . Tolstoyans identify themselves as Christians , but do not generally belong to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple life , preferring to be vegetarian , non-smoking , teetotal and chaste . Tolstoyans are considered Christian pacifists and advocate nonresistance in all circumstances . They do not support or participate in the government which they consider immoral , violent and corrupt . Tolstoy rejected the state ( as it only exists on the basis of physical force ) and all institutions that are derived from it - the police , law courts and army . Tolstoy influenced Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who set up a cooperative colony called Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg , South Africa , having been inspired by Tolstoy 's ideas . The colony comprising 1,100 acre was funded by the Gandhian Herman Kallenbach and placed at the disposal of the satyagrahis from 1910 . He also inspired similar communal experiments in the United States where the residents were also influenced by the views of Henry George and Edward Bellamy. , as well as in Russia , England and the Netherlands . # Mid 20th century # Several anarchists from the mid-20th century , including Herbert Read , Ethel Mannin , Leopold Kohr , and Paul Goodman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1944 book ' ' Bread and Roses : A Utopian Survey and Blue-Print ' ' has been described by anarchist historian Robert Graham as setting forth an ecological vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive industrial organization of society . # Leopold Kohr # Leopold Kohr ( 5 October 1909 in Oberndorf bei Salzburg , Austria 26 February 1994 in Gloucester , England ) was an economist , philosopher and political scientist known both for his opposition to the cult of bigness in social organization and as one of those who initiated the ' ' small is beautiful ' ' movement . For almost twenty years he was Professor of Economics and Public Administration at the University of Puerto Rico . He described himself as a philosophical anarchist . In 1937 , Kohr became a freelance correspondent during the Spanish Civil War , where he was impressed by the limited , self-contained governments of the separatist states of Catalonia and Aragon , as well as the small Spanish anarchist city states of Alcoy and Caspe . In his first published essay Disunion Now : A Plea for a Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 , Kohr wrote about a Europe at war : We have ridiculed the many little states , now we are terrorized by their few successors . He called for the breakup of Europe into hundreds of city states . Kohr developed his ideas in a series of books , including ' ' The Breakdown of Nations ' ' ( 1957 ) , ' ' Development without Aid ' ' ( 1973 ) and ' ' The Overdeveloped Nations ' ' ( 1977 ) . From Leopold Kohr 's most popular work ' ' The Breakdown of Nations ' ' : # ... there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery : bigness . Oversimplified as this may seem , we shall find the idea more easily acceptable if we consider that bigness , or oversize , is really much more than just a social problem . It appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation . Whenever something is wrong , something is too big . ... And if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement . It is because human beings , so charming as individuals or in small aggregations , have been welded into overconcentrated social units . # Later in his academic and writing career he protested the cult of bigness and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life . He argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation . His vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control . Kohr was an important inspiration to the Green , bioregional , Fourth World , decentralist , and anarchist movements , Kohr contributed often to John Papworth 's Journal for the Fourth World ' , Resurgence . One of Kohr 's students was economist E. F. Schumacher , another prominent influence on these movements , whose best selling book ' ' Small Is Beautiful ' ' took its title from one of Kohr 's core principles . Similarly , his ideas inspired Kirkpatrick Sale 's books ' ' Human Scale ' ' ( 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bioregional Vision ' ' ( 1985 ) . Sale arranged the first American publication of ' ' The Breakdown of Nations ' ' in 1978 and wrote the foreword . # Murray Bookchin # Murray Bookchin ( January 14 , 1921 July 30 , 2006 ) was an American libertarian socialist author , orator , and philosopher . In 1958 , Murray Bookchin defined himself as an anarchist , seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology . His first book , ' ' Our Synthetic Environment , ' ' was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber in 1962 , a few months before Rachel Carson 's ' ' Silent Spring ' ' . The book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism . His groundbreaking essay Ecology and Revolutionary Thought introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics . In 1968 he founded another group that published the influential ' ' Anarchos ' ' magazine , which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy , and on decentralization and miniaturization . Lecturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ecology to the counterculture . ' ' Post-Scarcity Anarchism ' ' is a collection of essays written by Murray Bookchin and first published in 1971 by Ramparts Press . It outlines the possible form anarchism might take under conditions of post-scarcity . It is one of Bookchin 's major works , and its radical thesis provoked controversy for being utopian and messianic in its faith in the liberatory potential of technology . Bookchin argues that post-industrial societies are also post-scarcity societies , and can thus imagine the fulfillment of the social and cultural potentialities latent in a technology of abundance . The self-administration of society is now made possible by technological advancement and , when technology is used in an ecologically sensitive manner , the revolutionary potential of society will be much changed . In 1982 , his book ' ' The Ecology of Freedom ' ' had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement , both in the United States and abroad . He was a principal figure in the Burlington Greens in 1986-90 , an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cities ' ' ( originally published in 1987 as ' ' The Rise of Urbanization and the Decline of Citizenship ' ' ) , Bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept . A few years later ' ' The Politics of Social Ecology ' ' , written by his partner of 20 years , Janet Biehl , briefly summarized these ideas . # Jacques Ellul # Jacques Ellul ( January 6 , 1912 May 19 , 1994 ) was a French philosopher , law professor , sociologist , lay theologian , and Christian anarchist . He wrote several books about Christianity , the technological society , propaganda , and the interaction between religion and politics . Professor of History and the Sociology of Institutions on the Faculty of Law and Economic Sciences at the University of Bordeaux , he authored 58 books and more than a thousand articles over his lifetime in all , the dominant theme of which has been the threat to human freedom and religion created by modern technique . The Ellulian concept of technique is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Technological Society ' ' ( 1964 ) . What many consider to be Ellul 's most important work , ' ' The Technological Society ' ' ( 1964 ) was originally titled : ' ' La Technique : L'enjeu du sicle ' ' ( literally , The Stake of the Century ) . In it , Ellul set forth seven characteristics of modern technology that make efficiency a necessity : rationality , artificiality , automatism of technical choice , self-augmentation , monism , universalism , and autonomy . For Ellul the rationality of technique enforces logical and mechanical organization through division of labor , the setting of production standards , etc . And it creates an artificial system which eliminates or subordinates the natural world . Today , he argues , the technological society is generally held sacred ( cf. Saint Steve Jobs ) . Since he defines technique as the totality of methods rationally arrived at , and having absolute efficiency ( for a given stage of development ) in every field of human activity , it is clear that his sociological analysis focuses not on the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient techniques . # Contemporary developments # Notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include Derrick Jensen , Jaime Semprun , George Draffan , John Zerzan , Starhawk and Alan Carter . # Social ecology and communalism # Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and influenced by anarchist Peter Kropotkin . Social ecologists assert that the present ecological crisis has its roots in human social problems , and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human . Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called Communalism ( spelled with a capital C to differentiate it from other forms of communalism ) . While originally conceived as a form of Social anarchism , he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism , Marxism , syndicalism , and radical ecology . Politically , Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens ' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion . This method used to achieve this is called Libertarian Municipalism which involves the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state . Janet Biehl ( born 1953 ) is a writer associated with social ecology , the body of ideas developed and publicized by Murray Bookchin . In 1986 , she attended the Institute for Social Ecology and there , began a collaborative relationship with Bookchin , working intensively with him over the next two decades in the explication of social ecology from their shared home in Burlington , Vermont . From 1987 to 2000 , she and Bookchin co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter ' ' Green Perspectives ' ' , later renamed ' ' Left Green Perspectives ' ' . She is the editor and compiler of ' ' The Murray Bookchin Reader ' ' ( 1997 ) ; the author of ' ' The Politics of Social Ecology : Libertarian Municipalism ' ' ( 1998 ) and ' ' Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics ' ' ( 1991 ) ; and coauthor ( with Peter Staudenmaier ) of ' ' Ecofascism : Lessons from the German Experience ' ' ( 1995 ) . # ' ' Green Anarchist ' ' # The magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal voice in the UK advocating green anarchism , an explicit fusion of libertarian socialist and ecological thinking . Founded after the 1984 Stop the City protests , the magazine was launched in the summer of that year by an editorial collective consisting of Alan Albon , Richard Hunt and Marcus Christo . Early issues featured a range of broadly anarchist and ecological ideas , bringing together groups and individuals as varied as Class War , veteran anarchist writer Colin Ward , anarcho-punk band Crass , as well as the Peace Convoy , anti-nuclear campaigners , animal rights activists and so on . However the diversity that many saw as the publication 's greatest strength quickly led to irreconcilable arguments between the essentially pacifist approach of Albon and Christo , and the advocacy of violent confrontation with the State favoured by Hunt . During the 1990s ' ' Green Anarchist ' ' came under the helm of an editorial collective that included Paul Rogers , Steve Booth and others , during which period the publication became increasingly aligned with primitivism , an anti-civilization philosophy advocated by writers such as John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , Hampshire Police began a series of at least 56 raids , code named ' Operation Washington ' , that eventually resulted in the August to November 1997 Portsmouth trial of Green Anarchist editors Booth , Saxon Wood , Noel Molland and Paul Rogers , as well as Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) Press Officer Robin Webb and Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group ( ALFSG ) newsletter editor Simon Russell . The defendants organised the GANDALF Defence campaign . Three of the editors of Green Anarchist , Noel Molland , Saxon Wood and Booth were jailed for ' conspiracy to incite ' . However , all three were shortly afterwards released on appeal . # Fredy Perlman # Fredy Perlman ( August 20 , 1934 July 26 , 1985 ) was a Czech-born , naturalised American author , publisher and militant .

According to anarcho-primitivism , the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification , coercion , and alienation . Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non- civilized ways of life through deindustrialisation , abolition of the division of labour or specialization , and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies . There are other non-anarchist forms of primitivism , and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern , civilized problems . Anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through rewilding . # # John Zerzan # # John Zerzan is an American anarchist and primitivist philosopher and author .
