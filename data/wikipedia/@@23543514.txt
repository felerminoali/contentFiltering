Taylor was abandoned at the 7/11 on the Jellicoe Road by her mother when she was 11 , and her only recollection of her father is a brief memory of standing on her father 's shoulders . The only adult influence in her life is her mentor/guardian Hannah , who lives in the unfinished house by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the 1980s and who has suddenly vanished into thin air at a time when Taylor really needs her . To top all of Taylors problems off , there is a territory war going on between the boarders , the Townies ( kids from the Jellicoe Town ) and the Cadets ( Sydney boys who come for a six-week training exercise every year to Jellicoe ) . The leader of the cadets this year happens to be the very boy who Taylor ran away with when she was 14 in search of her mother . The one who betrayed her trust and she never wants to see again . Running parallel to Taylor 's story is the story that Hannah writes , about the five kids in the 1980s . As Hannah has not yet compiled it , the story is shown in pieces throughout the novel with her handwriting . # Blurb # United States Taylor Markham is not a popular choice .

Jonah , who was traumatized by this act , attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train , but , on the day he planned it , he met Taylor and he decided he did n't want to kill himself in front of her . So instead he catches the train with her , and they travel to Yass . Once they get off , they attempt to hitchhike with a postman to Sydney where Taylor 's mother is supposed to be , but Jonah has a dream from his dead father saying ' if you go any further , you wo n't come back . ' ( although it is revealed later that the postman they rode with was the serial killer that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So that night , Jonah rings his school , and the next day the Brigadier shows up and takes them both back to Jellicoe . Taylor sees this act as a great betrayal , and she refuses to speak to Jonah again .

He is the eldest child and only son , with four younger female siblings - Mary , Elisha , Tilly and Sarah Santangelo who often drive him insane .

Raffy is considered to be a traitor by Chaz and the Townies for attending Jellicoe School . She was an outsider at Jellicoe School in her younger years , along with Taylor and Ben , the Violinist .
