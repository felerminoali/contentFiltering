widthimperial= ' ' The Old Plantation ' ' is an American folk art watercolor likely painted in the late 18th century on a South Carolina plantation . It is notable for its early date , its credible , non-stereotypical depiction of slaves on the North American mainland , and the fact that the slaves are shown pursuing their own interests . The artist has been identified as South Carolina slaveholder John Rose , and the painting may depict his plantation in what is now Beaufort County . # Description and interpretation # The painting depicts African American slaves between two small outbuildings of a plantation sited on a broad river . ' ' The Old Plantation ' ' is the only known painting of its era that depicts African Americans by themselves , concerned only with each other , though its central activity remains obscure . Some writers have speculated that the painting depicts a marriage ceremony , with the attendant tradition of jumping the broom . However , scholars have suggested that the subjects are performing a secular dance : western African dance patterns traditionally include sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of West African origin . The painting features two male musicians , one of whom is playing a stringed instrument that resembles a Yoruba molo ; the body of this instrument seems to be a hollow gourd . The molo is a precursor to the banjo , and this is the earliest known American painting to picture a banjo-like instrument . The second musician is playing a percussion instrument that may be a Yoruba gudugudu . The two women hold what look like scarves , but are actually sheguras , rattles made of a gourd enclosed in a net of variable length into which hard objects have been woven . # Artist and provenance # For decades the identity of the artist was unknown , as was the painting 's provenance prior to 1935 , when it was purchased by Holger Cahill from Mary E. Lyles of Columbia , South Carolina . However , in 2010 , Susan P. Shames , a librarian at Colonial Williamsburg , published a book titled ' ' The Old Plantation : The Artist Revealed ' ' in which she argues the artist was South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image depicts slaves on Rose 's plantation in what is now Beaufort County , South Carolina , or one nearby . In 1775 , Rose was named Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in Beaufort District , an appointment implying his educated status and familiarity with governing officials . By 1795 , he owned a lot in the town of Beaufort , as well as a rural , 813-acre tract on the Coosaw River in Prince William Parish . He employed slave labor to farm the latter property . At least fifty of these slaves have been identified by name , and he likely he owned others . Shames suggests the slaves and plantation depicted in the image were Rose 's own . However , the broad river in the middle ground raises questions about whether Rose owned property on both sides of this natural boundary and , thus , whether he depicted his own dwelling and outbuildings in the background , or a neighbor 's .

According to Shames , it remained in the family for more than a hundred years , until it was finally sold at an auction of the estate of Rose Rowan Ellis Copes ( 18461927 ) of Orangeburg , South Carolina , probably in 1928 or 1929 . It was bought either by an unidentified interim dealer or by Mary Earle Lyles ( b. 1878 ) of Columbia . It was certainly in Lyles ' possession by 1935 , when it was purchased by Holger Cahill , acting as agent for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller . According to Lyles , however , it was painted on a plantation between Charleston and Orangeburg . A watermark on the paper has been identified as that used by the English papermaker James Whatman II ( 17411798 ) between 1777 and 1794 . Rockefeller and Cahill transferred the painting to Williamsburg , Virginia to be part of the Rockefeller collection at the Ludwell-Paradise House . It was later gifted to Colonial Williamsburg .
