Joseph Leon Edel ( 9 September 1907 &amp;ndash ; 5 September 1997 ) was a North American literary critic and biographer . He was the elder brother of North American philosopher Abraham Edel . The ' ' Encyclopdia Britannica ' ' calls Edel the foremost 20th-century authority on the life and works of Henry James . His work on James won him both a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize . # Life # Born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , Edel grew up in Yorkton , Saskatchewan . He attended McGill University and the Universit de Paris . While at the former he was associated with the Montreal Group of modernist writers , which included F.R. Scott and A.J.M.

Though he wrote on James Joyce ( ' ' James Joyce : The Last Journey ' ' , 1947 ) and on the Bloomsbury group , his lifework is summed up in his five-volume biography of Henry James ( ' ' Henry James : A Biography ' ' 1953&amp;ndash ; 1972 ) . Edel discussed the notion of biography in ' ' Literary Biography ' ' ( 1957 ) , in particular his conviction that literary biography should enfold a subjective author 's self-perceptions into his output .

Edel enjoyed privileged access to letters and documents from James ' life housed in the Widener Library at Harvard University , after gaining the blessing of members of James ' family .

Edel did treat James 's relationships with novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson and sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen at length , especially in volumes three and four of the biography . After weighing all the evidence , Edel confessed that he was unable to decide whether James experienced a consummated sexual relationship . Although later scholarship and new materials have called into question the accuracy of his portrait of James , Edel 's work remains an important source for studies of the author . : ' ' A biography seems irrelevant if it does n't discover the overlap between what the individual did and the life that made this possible . Without discovering that , you have shapeless happenings and gossip .
