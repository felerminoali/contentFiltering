' ' Islay ' ' is a novel by author Douglas Bullard . It is the first and possibly the only novel by a Deaf American to focus on Deaf culture ( Peters 122 ) . ' ' Islay ' ' was published in 1986 by T.J. PUBLISHERS , INC. located in Silver Spring , Maryland . The novel tells the story of the protagonist Lyson Sulla , who has a goal of becoming Governor of the State of Islay and making it a state by and for Deaf people . # About the Author # Douglass Bullard ( 19372005 ) , was a graduate of Gallaudet College . He grew up in the Deep South and traveled around the world as well as lived in many different places . He was an Alaskan geologist and is the author of several novels . ' ' Islay ' ' , however , is the only work of his that was published . He was the president of the Florida Association of the Deaf for some time . # Writing Style # ' ' Islay ' ' is written an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English , while there is a written gloss form of American Sign Language that is used for dialogue between characters . This gloss form of ASL is written in italics and is neither truly English nor truly ASL . An example of this gloss form , coming from Lyson about his desire for a homeland for the Deaf is as follows : ' ' You know that Laurent Clerc had same dream . Himself greatest deaf in history , started Golden Age for deaf there France . Then brought sign here America ; almost started new Golden Age for us deaf , but hearing oralism frustrated him , broke up deaf cooperation and almost destroyed Sign Language . That why Clerc liked idea for deaf gathering into one state where deaf itself normal ! ' ' ( 6-7 ) . If the reader is a signer of ASL , they can see that the way this gloss form is written shows word order of ASL signs . However , this is not an accurate portrayal of ASL and the beauty and visual aspect of the language are not done justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the differences between spoken English and signed language . There are also parts of the novel written in bold capital letters that are used to describe conversations through a TTY . An example of this writing form is as follows : MARY HERE . WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN Q. I WAITED SINCE SIX . DISGUSTED GA . ( 67 ) . When using a TTY , the ' Q ' after a sentence makes it a question . ' GA ' means go ahead , which informs the person on the other line that you are done talking and they can type their response . For some , understanding the varying written forms within ' ' Islay ' ' is confusing and hard to understand . If one has a background in American Sign Language and is familiar with TTYs , they will more easily understand the glossed form of ASL and the TTY text . # Title Meaning # When the book was first released , there was much talk about what the title meant . Some people speculated it was a mix of the finger spelled acronyms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASL ) while others hypothesized it was derived from island .
