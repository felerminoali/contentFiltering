birthplace = Donetsk Oblast , Ukrainian SSR , Soviet Union Nikolai Ivanovich Ryzhkov ( Russian : , ' ' Nikolaj Ivanovi Rykov ' ' ; born 28 September 1929 ) is a former Soviet official who became a Russian politician following the dissolution of the Soviet Union . He served as the last Chairman of the Council of Ministers ( the post was abolished and replaced by that of Prime Minister in 1991 ) . Responsible for the cultural and economic administration of the Soviet Union during the late Gorbachev Era , Ryzhkov was succeeded as premier by Valentin Pavlov in 1991 . The same year , he lost his seat on the Presidential Council going on to become Boris Yeltsin 's leading opponent in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) 1991 presidential election . Ryzhkov was born in the city of Dzerzhynsk , Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929 . After graduating in the 1950s he started work in the 1970s and began his political career in local industry , working his way up through the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries . In 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee . Following Nikolai Tikhonov 's resignation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers , Ryzhkov was voted into office in his place . During his tenure , he supported Mikhail Gorbachev 's 1980s reform of the Soviet economy . Elected to the State Duma of the Russian Federation in December 1995 as an independent , Ryzhkov subsequently led the Power to the People block , later becoming the formal leader of the People 's Patriotic Union of Russia alongside Gennady Ziuganov , who was an unofficial leader . On 17 September 2003 , he resigned his seat in the Duma and became a member of the Federation Council . # Early life and career # Ryzhkov was born on 28 September 1929 in Dzerzhynsk , Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , Soviet Union . He graduated from the Ural Polytechnic Institute in 1959 . A technocrat , he started work as a welder then rose through the ranks at the Sverdlovsk Uralmash Plant to become chief engineer , then between 1970&amp;ndash ; 1975 , Factory Director of the Uralmash Production Amalgamation . Ryzhkov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow in 1975 and appointed to the post of First Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Heavy and Transport Machine Building . Ryzhkov became First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee in 1979 and was elected to the CPSU Central Committee in 1981 . He was one of several members of the Soviet leadership affiliated to the Andrei Kirilenko faction . Yuri Andropov appointed Ryzhkov head of the Economic Department of the Central Committee where he was responsible for overseeing major planning and financial organs , excluding industry . As head of the department he reported directly to Mikhail Gorbachev When Gorbachev came to power , Nikolai Tikhonov , the Chairman of the Council of Ministers , was elected Chairman of the newly established Commission on Improvements to the Management System . His title of chairman was largely honorary , with Ryzhkov the ' ' de facto ' ' head through his position as deputy chairman . The 30 km radius was a purely random guess and it was later shown that several areas contaminated with radioactive material were left untouched by government evacuation agencies . In the aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryzhkov promised to rebuild the city of Spitak within two years . A Politburo commission was established to provide guidance for the local ASSR Government with Ryzhkov elected its chairman . The commission then travelled to the ASSR to assess damage caused by the earthquake . During Gorbachev 's subsequent visit to the ASSR , and aware of local feelings following the disaster , Ryzhkov persuaded the less sensitive Gorbachev to forgo use of his limousine in favor of public transport . When Gorbachev left the ASSR , Ryzhkov remained to coordinate the rescue operation and made several television appearances which increased his standing amongst the Soviet leadership and the people in general . With his standing thus boosted , on 19 July 1988 , at the Central Committee Plenum , Ryzhkov criticised nearly every one of Gorbachev 's policies , further complaining that as Party Secretary he should devote more time to the Party . In the end , Ryzhkov failed in his promise to rebuild Spitak , partly due to the Soviet Union 's mounting economic problems , and partly because many of the city 's Soviet era buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reconstruction more difficult . # Economic policy # Historian Jerry F. Hough notes that Gorbachev treated Ryzhkov and his reform attempts just as badly as Leonid Brezhnev treated Alexei Kosygin , one-time Chairman of the Council of Ministers , during the Brezhnev Era . Brezhnev 's most notable snub was over the 1965 Soviet economic reform . Ryzhkov was an early supporter of the Gorbachev policy calling for an increase in the quantity and quality of goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan ( 1986&amp;ndash ; 1990 ) . To achieve these goals , the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by , Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance . He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors ; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility . However , Ryzhkov 's economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods . Gorbachev and Ligachev 's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov , who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state billions of rubles in income . Nevertheless , the campaign went ahead , losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues . Ryzhkov 's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations , and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect . Ryzhkov and Gorbachev continued their work on economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise , which restricted the authority of central planners . This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power . Nikolai Talyzin , Chairman of the State Planning Committee , became the scapegoat for the failure of this reform and on the orders of Ryzhkov he was replaced by Yuri Maslyukov . While supporting the transition away from a planned economy , Ryzhkov understood that privatisation would weaken the government 's power . As changes occurred , skepticism over ' ' perestroika ' ' and privatisation was not limited to high-level government officialdom . Several middle and low-ranking officials , who owed their rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing system . Gorbachev also blamed Ryzhkov and the Council of Ministers for the economic difficulties which arose during ' ' perestroika ' ' , a move which fostered resentment for both Gorbachev and ' ' perestroika ' ' . Nevertheless in 1986 , Ryzhkov stated that he , along with the rest of the Soviet leadership , were already discussing the possibility of creating a market economy in the Soviet Union . Ryzhkov supported the creation of a regulated market economy where the government sector occupied the commanding heights of the economy as well as the creation of semi private-public companies . His second cabinet , several high-standing members of the KGB and the military establishment all supported Ryzhkov 's opposition to the 500 Days Programme , which espoused a quick transition to a market economy . Matters did not improve when at the second session of the Congress of People 's Deputies of the Soviet Union , Ryzhkov proposed postponing the transition to a market economy until 1992 , further suggesting that in the period between 1990&amp;ndash ; 1992 , recentralisation of government activities would ensure a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Leonid Abalkin 's and one created by himself in conjunction with the Maslyukov chaired State Planning Committee along with several other government institutions . With strong support from Ryzhkov , Gorbachev abolished the Central Committee economic department , thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters . From then on , the government could not be blamed for economic policies initiated by the Party leadership . The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened the power of the government apparatus ; a move Ryzhkov and Ryzhkov 's Second Government # Price reform # According to Swedish economist Anders slund , Ryzhkov differed little from Gorbachev when it came to price reform . By 1988 Ryzhkov increasingly sided with Leonid Abalkin , one of the few economists who advocated fiscal responsibility . At the 19th Conference of the Central Committee , Abalkin was severely criticised by Gorbachev , and accused of economic determinism . Several conference delegates agreed with Gorbachev , but Ryzhkov 's support remained solid . Abalkin was ordered to deliver a report to the Presidium of the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put financial stability at the top of its agenda . Gorbachev disliked Abalkin 's report and rejected Ryzhkov 's requests that he support it . Ryzhkov was then forced to create an even more conservative reform plan for 1989 in which price reform was to be postponed until 1991 . When the Abalkin report was proposed at the Central Committee plenum , the majority of delegates indirectly attacked Gorbachev for his indecisiveness when it came to the implementation of price reform . In April 1990 , after submitting a draft to the Presidential Council and the Federation Council , Ryzhkov 's price reform was initiated . However , a short while later it was once more put on hold following severe criticism from Boris Yeltsin and several pro-Gorbachev intellectuals . The economic turmoil which hit the Soviet Union in 1990 was blamed on Ryzhkov , even though it was Gorbachev who had delayed Ryzhkov 's proposed reform . In his memoirs , Gorbachev vaguely asserts that a single price increase would be better than several . # Fall from power # In August 1990 several leading officials tried to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure , fearing that Ryzhkov 's removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members . Ryzhkov 's numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues ; they backed him simply because he opposed some of Gorbachev 's economic and political reforms . Ryzhkov 's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar , with both supporting price liberalisation , decentralisation and privatisation . In December 1990 Ryzhkov suffered a heart attack . During his recovery , the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the Council of Ministers and replaced it with the Cabinet of Ministers ( Soviet Union ) # RSFSR politics and post-Soviet Russia # After recovering from his heart attack , in early 1991 Ryzhkov stood as the Communist candidate in the first election of the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) . At the election on 12 June 1991 , he gained 13,395,335 votes , equal to 16.9% of the electorate . Boris Yeltsin beat him decisively with 57% . Ryzhkov 's vice presidential candidate was Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military during the final stages of the war in Afghanistan . Most of Ryzhkov 's votes came from the countryside , while he had hoped to win over voters who were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result of ' ' perestroika ' ' and Gorbachev 's leadership , even though the latter supported his candidacy . During the Russian legislative election , 1995 In 1996 , Ryzhkov was one of the founders of the CPRF-led alliance of leftists and nationalists known as the People 's Patriotic Union of Russia ( PPUR ) and was elected chairman of its Duma faction . The PPUR 's formal leaders were Ryzhkov and Ziuganov , who was an unofficial leader . In September 2003 , Ryzhkov entered the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation as the representative for Belgorod Oblast , subsequently resigning his seat in the State Duma . He currently serves as Chairman of the Federation Council Commission on Natural Monopolies , as a member of the Committee on Local Self-Governance and as co-chairman of the RussianArmenian commission on inter-parliamentary cooperation . # Awards , decorations and orders # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour twice , in 1966 and 1985 , the Order of the October Revolution in 1971 , the Order of Lenin in 1976 and 1979 and the Order of Merit for the Fatherland , 4th class ( 27 September 2004 - for outstanding contribution to the strengthening of the Russian state and many years of diligent work ) .
