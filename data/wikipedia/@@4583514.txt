Typhoon Karen was the most powerful tropical cyclone to strike Guam and was regarded as one of the most destructive events in the island 's history . Karen was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November 6 , 1962 , well to the southeast of Truk . Over the following two days , the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified . After becoming a tropical storm late on November 7 , Karen explosively intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon by November 9 . Turning westward , the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280 km/h ( 175 mph ) on November 11 . Once clear of the island , it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November 13 with winds of 295 km/h ( 185 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 894 mb ( hPa ; 26.40 inHg ) . The storm then gradually turned northward as it weakened , brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November 15 , before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific . Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day between Alaska and Hawaii . Striking Guam with unprecedented intensity , Karen devastated the island with wind gusts estimated up to 280 km/h ( 185 mph ) . Ninety-five percent of homes were damaged or destroyed , leaving at least 45,000 people homeless . It was regarded as the worst typhoon to ever strike the island . Communication and utilities were crippled , forcing officials to set up water distribution centers in order to avoid the spread of water-borne diseases . Total losses on the island amounted to $250 million . Despite the severity of damage , only 11 people were killed . In the wake of the storm , a massive relief operation began that involved the evacuation of thousands to either California , Hawaii , or Wake Island . Thousands more were sheltered in public buildings and later tent villages for many months . More than $60 million in relief funds were sent to Guam over the following years to aid in rehabilitation . Though the storm 's effects were devastating , it was later attributed with improving the overall quality of life as building codes were reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 6 , 1962 , a tropical disturbance was identified several hundred miles south-southeast of Truk by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) . Tracking northwestward , the disturbance intensified and was classified a tropical depression early on November 7 . Later that day , the system passed to the east of Truk and turned due north before attaining gale-force winds . Around 1800 UTC , the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Storm Karen , the 27th named storm of the 1962 season . Several hours later , a reconnaissance mission into the storm revealed a partially closed 35kmmi abbr=on wide eye . Over the following 30 hours , Karen underwent a period of explosive intensification as its eye became small and increasingly defined . Between 0000 UTC on November 8 and 0340 UTC on November 9 , Karen 's barometric pressure plummeted from 990 mbar ( hPa ; 29.24 inHg ) to 899 mb ( hPa ; 26.55 inHg ) , a drop of 91 mb ( hPa ; 2.69 inHg ) . At the end of this phase , Karen featured a 8to10kmmi abbr=on wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 185 mph ) , ranking it as a modern day Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the SaffirSimpson hurricane scale . After attaining this initial peak intensity on November 9 , Karen weakened somewhat as it gradually curved west-northwestward . By 1514 UTC , the storm began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle as a larger secondary eyewall , approximately 64kmmi abbr=on in diameter , started developing . Although the storm 's winds failed to drop significantly , Karen 's central pressure rose to 919 mb ( hPa ; 27.14 inHg ) during this phase . Accelerating slightly , Karen tracked steadily west-northwestward towards Guam . By November 11 , the system had regained a well-defined eye and deepened once more . Between 1210 and 1235 UTC on November 11 , the 14kmmi abbr=on wide eye of Karen passed directly over southern Guam . At this time , the storm was estimated to have had winds of 280 km/h ( 175 mph ) , making it the most intense typhoon to strike the island since 1900 . However , post-storm analyses in the years after the typhoon indicate that it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Weather Bureau station at the north end of Guam , a pressure of 942.4 mb ( hPa ; 27.83 inHg ) was measured . Further south at Anderson Air Force Base , 939.7 mb ( hPa ; 27.75 inHg ) was recorded . The lowest verified pressure was 931.9 mb ( hPa ; 27.52 inHg ) at the Agana Naval Air Station . Closest to the eye was Naval Magazine where a pressure of 907.6 mb ( hPa ; 26.80 inHg ) was estimated . Continuing west-northwestward , Karen attained its peak intensity on November 13 with a central pressure of 894 mb ( hPa ; 26.40 inHg ) . Between November 13 and 14 , Karen gradually turned towards the north as it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle . During this time , Karen finally weakened below Category 5 status as its winds dropped below 251 km/h ( 156 mph ) . This marked the end of its near-record 4.25 day span as a storm of such intensity , second only to Typhoon Nancy of 1961 which maintained Category 5 status for 5.5 days . Over the following days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its eye no longer well-defined by November 15 . By this time , Karen began accelerating northeastward and later east-northeastward over the open ocean . The combination of its rapid movement and entrainment of cold air into the circulation ultimately caused the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 17 . The remnants of Karen continued tracking east-northeast and were last noted by the JTWC on November 18 roughly halfway between the southern Aleutian Islands and northern Hawaiian Islands . # Impact # # Guam #Following the identification of a tropical disturbance on November 6 , a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness ( TCOR ) , the lowest level of alert , was raised for Guam . By November 8 , three days prior to Karen 's arrival , this was raised to level three , prompting residents and military personnel to stock up on supplies . A public announcement was made that day as well , warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island . At 9:00 p.m. on November 10 ( 1100 UTC ) , a level two TCOR was put in place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed . By 8:00 a.m. ( 2200 UTC on November 10 ) , this was raised to level one , the highest level of warning . At this time , the ' ' USS Haverfield ' ' , ' ' USS Brister ' ' , ' ' USS Wandank ' ' , and ' ' USS Banner ' ' sought refuge from the storm over open waters . All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared . Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage . Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island . Roughly 24 hours after the typhoon 's passage , all warnings were discontinued . Striking Guam as a Category 5-equivalent typhoon , Karen produced destructive winds across much of the island . With the eye passing over the southern tip of the territory , the most intense winds were felt over central areas . Wind gusts over the southern tip of Guam were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Due to the extreme nature of these winds , all anemometers on the island failed before the most intense portion of the storm arrived . As such , there were no measurements of the strongest winds ; however , post-storm reports estimated that sustained winds reached 250 km/h ( 155 mph ) in some areas . The highest known gust was measured at 240 km/h ( 145 mph ) by a United States Navy anemometer on Nimitz Hill just before 1100 UTC on November 11 , roughly two hours before the typhoon 's eye passed the station . Based on this measurement , a study in 1996 estimated that gusts peaked between 280 and 295 km/h ( 175 and 185 mph ) over southern areas of the island . Newspaper reports indicated that a gust of 272km/hmph abbr=on was measured on the island before the anemometer was destroyed . There was also an unverified report of a 333km/hmph abbr=on wind gust . Nearly all measurements of rainfall during the typhoon were lost ; the only known total is 7.76inmm disp=flip at the Weather Bureau station for the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the winds , with some homes being leveled and others nearby having only minor damage , akin to the impacts of tornadoes . The winds uprooted and snapped palm trees across the island and , in some instances , stripped the bark of tree trunks and branches as if they were sandblasted . Damage to vegetation was total across central areas of the island , with complete defoliation taking place . In some places , it was described as the aftermath of a forest fire . The winds also blew debris across the island . Metal roofing was found wrapped around trees . In one instance , a twin-engine aircraft was carried 2.4km mi from the hangar it was tied down in . A metal sign bolted into a warehouse was tossed 3.7km mi and found half-buried in the ground . Elsewhere , a quonset hut was lofted and carried for 411ftm abbr=on , intact , before being crushed on impact . Along the coast , the ' ' USS Arco ' ' was torn from her moorings , severing two anchors and shearing a cleat tested for over 50000and100000lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROK Han Ra San ' ' and ' ' RPS Negros Oriental ' ' sunk in the inner harbor of Guam . Regarded as the worst typhoon to ever impact Guam , acting governor Manuel Guerrero stated that the entire territory was devastated . Nearly every structure , both civilian and military , were severely damaged or destroyed . Even reinforced concrete structures at Anderson Air Force Base sustained severe damage . Though these structures withstood the direct impact of winds , sudden drops in pressure caused windows to shatter in most structures , ultimately exposing the interior to water damage . Military structures suffered the most from this phenomenon as the buildings were designed in a way that pressure differences between the interior and exterior would not equal out . Debris from damaged or destroyed homes became projectiles during the storm that created further damage . The effects of this were regarded as similar to being bombarded with shrapnel or artillery missiles . George Washington High and Tumon Junior High were both destroyed . Guam Memorial Hospital and the island 's public works department were extensively damaged . Downtown Hagta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's main road , Marine Drive , 20cmin abbr=on of sand accumulated from Karen 's storm surge . Overall , the city was 85 percent destroyed , while the villages of Yona and Inarajan were 97 and 90 percent destroyed , respectively . Additionally , Agana Heights and Sinajana were reportedly leveled . The communication network on the island was completely destroyed as antennas and transmission equipment were blown away . Approximately 30 percent of telephone poles between the island 's naval station and Nimitz Hill and 95 percent of civilian telephone poles were downed . The power grid was also destroyed . The Guam portion of the Pacific Scatter Communications System suffered extensive damage , with all four 61mft abbr=on tall antennae at Ritidian Point being reduced to a mess of tangled , twisted steel and cable . Losses from the antennae alone reached $1 million . All airstrips on the island were rendered inoperable , hampering initial relief efforts . Numerous roads across the island were also impassible , covered by downed trees and smashed vehicles . The wreckage left in the wake of the storm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homes were destroyed , Nearly every non-typhoon proof home was severely damaged or destroyed and a majority of typhoon proof buildings sustained extensive damage . Preliminary surveys by the Red Cross on November 15 indicated that at least 5,000 homes were destroyed and another 3,000 were severely damaged . Approximately 45,000 people , mostly Guamanians , were left homeless . A total of 11 people lost their lives and about 100 others were injured . At least four of the deaths were due to collapsed buildings , including three in one home that buckled due to pounding surf . Losses across the island amounted to $250 million ( 1962 USD ) . The damage across Guam was described as ' much more serious than that of Battle of Guam ( 1944 ) 1944 ' when United States troops liberated the island . The U.S. Navy described it as equal to the impacts of an indirect hit from a nuclear bomb . It was also stated that the rehabilitation effort over the previous 17 years had been completely wiped out . # Elsewhere # In the Mariana Islands , three ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . sank ; however , the crew had been evacuated prior to the storm 's arrival . On November 13 , a level three TCOR was issued for Okinawa . This prompted military personnel to begin securing the island and prepare planes without hangars for evacuation . Brushing the region as a Category 3-equivaelnt typhoon , Karen caused considerable disruptions to airlines , trains , shipping , and communications . However , no serious damage was reported in Okinawa . However , the ' ' Daiyumaru ' ' and another Japanese fishing vessel with a total of 26 crew went missing in the region . On November 15 , residents in Taiwan were urged to take precautions to minimize casualties . Prior to the storm 's arrival , the ' ' USS Duncan ' ' , the ' ' USS Kitty Hawk ' ' , and two other aircraft carriers sought refuge in the Taiwan Strait . Despite attempts to escape the storm , large swells exceeding 3.6mft abbr=on battered the vessels , causing them to pitch up to 59 degrees . At times , the waves crashed onto the deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to crewmen , waves up to 4.5mft abbr=on struck Taipei , leaving water marks on many buildings . # Aftermath #In the immediate aftermath of the typhoon , the Pacific Air Forces were on standby to deliver supplies to Guam ; however , they were delayed due to the inoperable airstrips . Despite damage at the Guam Memorial Hospital , other civilian and military installations were able to handle injured persons as many were transferred to the Navy 's hospital . On November 12 , Manuel Guerrero made an urgent appeal to the Government of the United States requesting that aid be rushed to the territory . Additionally , he instituted a curfew between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. local time for all residents to limit looting . At schools , teachers were called in to guard supplies and equipment . The Federal Emergency Management Agency , under order from United States President John F. Kennedy , declared Guam a major disaster area later that day , allowing residents to receive federal aid . Additionally , a 15 man team of United Stats Air Force communications technicians were deployed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guerrero estimated that it would take four months to complete repairs to utilities . It was also estimated that schools on the island would be closed for six months . Initially , residents across Guam were critical of the delayed response by the United States Government , because no aid arrived within two days of the storm ; however , this was due to unsafe conditions at airports preventing aircraft from landing . With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam , structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless . Similarly , damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians . By November 14 , the ' ' USS Daniel I. Sultan ' ' arrived in Guam with 1,100 troops to provide emergency power . A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies . About 400 troops and 80 public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November 14 . The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge coordinating recovery efforts . Water distribution centers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking water . On November 15 , a massive evacuation of residents began to remove survivors from unsafe conditions . Two flights to California took place on the first day of evacuation , carrying a total of 154 people . Thousands of residents were also brought to Wake Island for shelter . Military Air Transport Service planes from the United States mainland , Japan , the Philippines , and Hawaii were called in for the operation . On November 16 , residents were warned of a possible typhoid epidemic and urged to get inoculations for the disease . Over a three-day span , roughly 30,000 people were given preventative shots for the disease . In contrast to their previous ban on alien workers , the Government of Guam requested 1,500 carpenters , masons , and other building workers from the Philippines . By November 21 , the Navy Supply Depot planned to have enough supplies for the entire populous shipped until replenishment arrived . In order to shelter homeless , the United States Navy set up tent villages across the island . Military kitchens were also established to provide food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , news reports stated that the island had its saddest Thanksgiving in history with many unable to have a full meal . On November 21 , insurance payments for losses were expected to exceed $12 million . On January 1 , 1963 , a $2 million relief fund was authorized by President Kennedy . Another $5.4 million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February 15 , 1964 . The United States Congress provided Guam with $60 million , including $45 million through federal loans , in order for the territory to recover from the typhoon . The main purpose of these funds was for rehabilitation and to promote expansion of the economy . Additionally , the storm brought about the end of military security on the island , which in turn aided economic growth . Within five years of this decision , Japanese tourism to the island dramatically increased , prompting a major increase in the number of hotels . In the long-term , the impacts of Typhoon Karen and other destructive storms in Guam 's history shaped the development of the island 's infrastructure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could withstand powerful typhoons . Since Karen , most buildings on the island have been constructed with concrete and steel . Less than half a year after Karen , Typhoon Olive caused extensive damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands on April 29 , 1963 . With many residents living in tents , and debris from the storm still scattered about , severe damage was anticipated . Schools , churches , and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes . Ultimately , Guam was spared the worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated . The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36 hours . Though weaker than Karen , the drawn out impact of Pamela led it to be regarded as more destructive . Due to the severity of damage caused by the typhoon in Guam , the name ' ' Karen ' ' was retired and replaced with ' ' Kim ' ' .
