Eboracum was a fort and city in Roman Britain . The settlement evolved into York , located in North Yorkshire , England . # Etymology # The first known recorded mention of Eboracum by name is dated ' ' circa ' ' 95104 AD and is an address containing the Latin form of the settlement 's name , ' ' Eburaci ' ' , on a wooden stylus tablet from the Roman fortress of Vindolanda in what is now the modern Northumberland . During the Roman period , the name was also written in the form ' ' Eboracum ' ' and ' ' Eburacum ' ' . The etymology of Eboracum is uncertain as the language of the indigenous population of the area was never recorded . However , the generally accepted view of British history , is that the inhabitants of Britain at this time spoke a Celtic language related to modern Welsh . This language has been reconstructed from Latin place names and modern Celtic languages , and has been called by scholars Common Brythonic . The name Eboracum is thought to have derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means place of the yew trees . The word for yew was probably something like ' ' *ibura ' ' in Celtic ( cf. Old Irish ' ' ibar ' ' yew-tree , , , alder buckthorn , alder buckthorn ) , combined with the suffix ' ' *-ko(n) ' ' place ( cf. Welsh ' ' -og ' ' ) meaning place of the yew trees ( cf. ' ' efrog ' ' in Welsh , ' ' eabhrach/iubhrach ' ' in Irish Gaelic and ' ' eabhrach/iobhrach ' ' in Scottish Gaelic , by which names the city is known in those languages ) . The name is then thought to have been Latinized by replacing ' ' -acon ' ' with ' ' -acum ' ' , according to a common use noted in Gaul . The different vry , Ivry , Ivrey , Ivory in France would all come from ' ' *Eboracum / *Eboriacum ' ' f. e .

This was because the people in the area known as the Brigantes by the Romans became a Roman client state . When their leadership changed becoming more hostile to Rome , Roman General Quintus Petillius Cerialis led the Ninth Legion north from Lincoln across the Humber . Eboracum was founded in 71 AD when Cerialis and the Ninth Legion constructed a military fortress ( castra ) on flat ground above the River Ouse near its junction with the River Foss . In the same year Cerialis was appointed Governor of Britain . A legion at full strength at that time numbered some 5,500 men , and provided new trading opportunities for enterprising local people , who doubtless flocked to Eboracum to take advantage of them . As a result permanent civilian settlement grew up around the fortress especially on its south-east side . Civilians also settled on the opposite side of the Ouse , initially along the main road from Eboracum to the south-west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; streets were laid out , public buildings were erected and private houses spread out over terraces on the steep slopes above the river . # Military # # Fortress # From its foundation the Roman fort of Eboracum was aligned on a north-east/south-east bearing on the north bank of the River Ouse . It measured 1600 ' ' pes monetalis ' ' ( 473.6m ) by 1360 ' ' pes monetalis ' ' ( 402.56m ) and covered an area of 50 acre . The standard suit of streets running through the castra is assumed , although some evidence exists for the ' ' via praetoria ' ' , ' ' via decumana ' ' and ' ' via sagularis ' ' . Much of the modern understanding of the Fortress defences has come from extensive excavations undertake by Leslie Peter Wenham . The layout of the fortress also followed the standard for a legionary fortress with wooden buildings inside a square defensive boundary . These defences originally consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation , were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74 AD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf front on a new oak foundation , and eventually , wooden battlements were added which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers . The original wooden camp was refurbished by Agricola in 81 , before being completely rebuilt in stone between 107 and 108 . Multiple phases of restructuring and rebuilding within the fortress are recorded . Rebuilding in stone began in the early second century AD under Trajan but may have taken as long as the start of the reign of Septimius Severus to be completed ; a period of over 100 years . Estimates suggest that over 48000m  3  of stone were required , largely consisting of Magnesian Limestone from the quarries nearby the Roman settlement of Calcaria ( Tadcaster ) . # Emperors # There is evidence that the Emperor Hadrian visited in 122 on his way north to plan his great walled frontier . He certainly brought with him the Sixth Legion to replace the existing garrison . Emperor Septimius Severus visited Eboracum in 208 and made it his base for campaigning in Scotland . The fortress wall was probably reconstructed during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this work standing almost to full height . The Imperial court was based in York until at least AD211 , in which year Severus died and was succeeded by his sons , Caracalla and Geta . In the later 3rd century , the western Empire experienced political and economic turmoil and Britain was for some time ruled by usurpers independent of Rome . It was after crushing the last of these that Emperor Constantius I came to Eboracum and , in 306 , became the second Emperor to die there . His son Constantine was instantly proclaimed as successor by the troops based in the fortress . Although it took Constantine eighteen years to become sole ruler of the Empire , he may have retained an interest in Eboracum and the reconstruction of the south-west front of the fortress with polygonally-fronted interval towers and the two great corner towers , one of which ( the ' Multangular Tower ' ) still survives , is probably his work . In the colonia , Constantine 's reign was a time of prosperity and a number of extensive stone town houses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans , Eboracum , was the major military base in the north of Britain and , following the 3rd century division of the province of Britannia , the capital of northern Britain , Britannia Inferior . By 237 Eboracum had been made a colonia , the highest legal status a Roman city could attain , one of only four in Britain and the others were founded for retired soldiers . This mark of Imperial favour was probably a recognition of Eboracum as the largest town in the north and the capital of Britannia Inferior . At around the same time Eboracum became self-governing , with a council made up of rich locals , including merchants , and veteran soldiers . In 296 Britannia Inferior was divided into two provinces of equal status with Eboracum becoming the provincial capital of Britannia Secunda. # Culture # As a busy port and a provincial capital ' ' Eboracum ' ' was a cosmopolitan city with residents from throughout the Roman Empire . # Diet # Substantial evidence for the use of cereal crops and animal husbandry can be found in ' ' Eboracum ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the North bank of the Ouse and outside the fortress , showed that spelt wheat was the most common cereal grain used at that time , followed by barley . Cattle , sheep/goat and pig are the major sources of meat . Hunting scenes , as shown through Romano-British ' hunt cups ' , suggest that hunting is a popular pastime and diet would be supplemented through the hunting of hare , deer and boar . A variety of food preparation vessels ( mortaria ) have been excavated from the city and large millstones used in the processing of cereals have been found in rural sites outside the colonia at Heslington and Stamford Bridge . In terms of the ceremonial use of food ; dining scenes are used on tombstones to represent an aspirational image of the deceased in the afterlife , reclining on a couch and being served food and wine . The tombstones of Julia Velva , Mantinia Maercia and Aelia Aeliana each depict a dining scene . Additionally , several inhumation burials from Trentholme Drive contained hen 's eggs placed in ceramic urns as grave goods for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roman religious beliefs among the people of Eboracum have been found including altars to Mars , Hercules , Jupiter and Fortune . In terms of number of references , the most popular deities were the spiritual representation ( ' ' genius ' ' ) of Eboracum and the Mother Goddess . There is also evidence of local and regional deities . Evidence showing the worship of eastern deities has also been found during excavations in York . For example evidence of the Mithras cult , which was popular among the military , has been found including a sculpture showing Mithras slaying a bull and a dedication to Arimanius , the god of evil in the Mithraic tradition . The Mithraic relief located in Mickelgate suggests the location of a temple to Mithras right in the heart of the Colonia . Another example is the dedication of a temple to Serapis a Hellenistic-Egyptian God by the Commander of the Sixth Legion . Other known deities from the city include : Tethys , Veteris , Venus , Silvanus , Toutatis , Chnoubis and the Imperial ' ' Numen ' ' . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown when this was first formed and in archaeological terms there is virtually no record of it . The first evidence of this community is a document noting the attendance of Bishop Eborius of Eboracum at the Council of Arles in 314 . The Episcopal see at Eboracum was called ' ' Eboracensis ' ' in Latin and Bishops from the See also attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325 , the Council of Sardica , and the Council of Ariminum. # Death and Burial # The cemeteries of Roman York follow the major Roman roads out of the settlement ; excavations in the Castle Yard ( next to Clifford 's Tower ) , beneath the railway station , at Trentholme Drive and the Mount have located significant evident for human remains using both inhumation and cremation burial rites . The cemetery beneath the railway station was subject to excavations in advance of railway works of 183941 , 1845 , and 18707 . Several sarcophagi were unearthed during this phase of excavations including those of Flavius Bellator and Julia Fortunata . Inhumation burial in sarcophagi can often include the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Variations on this combination exist . The gypsum casts , when found undisturbed , frequently retain a cast impression of the deceased in a textile shroud surviving examples of both adults and children show a selection of textiles used to wrap the body before interment , but usually plain woven cloth . The high number of sarcophagi from ' ' Eboracum ' ' has provided a large number of these casts , in some cases with cloth surviving adhered to the gypsum . Comparable cemetery sites in Roman Britain have provided evidence of the use of organic resins made from pine cones being used to seal the cloth shroud . An excavation in advance of building work underneath the Yorkshire Museum in 2009 located a male skeleton with significant pathology to suggest that he may have died as a gladiator in Eboracum . The Emperor Septimius Severus was cremated in Eboracum following his death in AD211 . The Roman biographer Cassius Dio records the event and described a scene in which the Emperor utters the final words to his two sons on his death bed : Agree with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Severus was cremated somewhere outside the fortress wall and again , Cassius Dio paints a picture : # His body arrayed in military garb was placed upon a pyre , and as a mark of honour the soldiers and his sons ran about it and as for the soldier 's gifts , those who had things at hand to offer them put them upon it and his sons applied the fire . # A hill to the West of the city , named ' Severus Hill ' is associated by some antiquarians as the site where this cremation took place , but no modern archaeological investigation has so far correlated this claim . # Economy # The military presence at Eboracum was the driving force behind early developments in its economy . In these early stages Eboracum operated as a command economy with workshops growing up outside the fortress to supply the needs of the 5000 troops garrisoned there . Production included military pottery until the mid-3rd century , military tile kilns have been found in the Aldwark-Peasholme Green area , glassworking at Coppergate , metalworks and leatherworks producing military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eboracum was the major manufacturing centre for Whitby Jet . Known as ' ' gagates ' ' in Latin , it was used from the early 3rd century as material for jewelry and was exported from here throughout Britain and into Europe . Examples found in York take the form of rings , bracelets , necklaces , and pendants depicting married couples and the Medusa . There are fewer than 25 jet pendants in the Roman world , of which six are known from Eboracum . These are housed in the Yorkshire Museum . # Roads # The true paths of all original Roman roads leading out of Eboracum are not known , although eleven have been suggested . The known roads include Dere Street leading North-West from the city through Clifton towards the site of ' ' Cataractonium ' ' ( modern Catterick ) , Cade 's Road Towards ' ' Petuaria ' ' ( modern Brough ) , and Ermine Street towards ' ' Lindum ' ' ( modern Lincoln ) . A road bypassing the south wall wall of the fortress , between the fortress and the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conjectured to run beneath the York Museum Gardens . # Rivers # The River Ouse and River Foss provided important access points for the importation of heavy goods . The existence of two possible wharves on the east bank of the River Foss support this idea . A large deposit of grain , in a timber-structure beneath modern day Coney Street , on the north-east bank of the River Ouse suggests the existence of storehouses for moving goods via the river . # Late Roman York # The decline of Roman Britain in early fifth century AD led to significant social and economic changes all over Britain . Whilst the latest datable inscription referencing ' ' Eboracum ' ' dates from AD237 , the continuation of the settlement after this time is certain . Building work in the city continued in the fourth century under Constantine and later Count Theodosius . The locally produced Crambeck Ware pottery arrives in ' ' Eboracum ' ' in the fourth century the most famous form being intricately decorated buff-yellow ' parchment ware ' painted with bright shades of red . The effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Roman Britain a bishop of York named ' Eborius ' is attested here and several artifacts decorated with chi-rho symbols are known . Additionally , a small bone plaque from an inhumation grave bore the phrase SOROR AVE VIVAS IN DEO ( ' Hail sister may you live in God ' ) . Changes in the layout of both the fort and ' ' colonia ' ' occurred in the late fourth century AD , suggested as representing a social change in the domestic lives of the military garrison here whereby they may be living in smaller family groups with wives , children or other civilians . # Rediscovery of Roman York # The rediscovery and modern understanding of ' ' Eboracum ' ' began in the 17th century . Several prominent figures have been involved in this process . Martin Lister was the first to recognise that the Multangular Tower was Roman in date in a 1683 paper with the Royal Society . John Horsley 's 1732 ' ' Britannia Romana ' ' , or ' The Roman Antiquities of Britain ' , included a chapter on Roman York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Eboracum ' ' the first book of its kind on Roman York . Drake also published accounts in the ' ' Philosophical Transactions ' ' of the Royal Society . The Rev. Charles Wellbeloved was one of the founders of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and a curator of the antiquities in the Yorkshire Museum until his death in 1858 . He published a systematic account of Roman York titled ' ' Eboracum or York under the Romans ' ' in 1842 , including first hand records of discoveries during excavations in 1835 . William Hargrove brought many new discoveries to the attention of the public through published articles in his newspaper the ' ' Herald ' ' and the ' ' Courant ' ' and published a series of guides with references to casual finds . The first large-scale excavations were undertaken by S. Miller from Glasgow University in the 1920s with a focus on the defences . # Archaeological remains # Substantial physical remains have been excavated in York in the last two centuries including the city walls , the legionary bath-house and headquarters building , civilian houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Remains of the Roman Basilica building , at the north side of the Principia are visible in the undercroft of York Minster .
