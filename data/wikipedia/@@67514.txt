Ununpentium is the temporary name of a synthetic superheavy element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uup and has the atomic number 115 . It is placed as a heavier homologue to bismuth and the heaviest member of group 15 ( VA ) . It was first observed in 2003 and about 50 atoms of ununpentium have been synthesized to date , with about 25 direct decays of the parent element having been detected . Four consecutive isotopes are currently known ,  287290  Uup , with  289  Uup having the longest measured half-life of 200 ms . On August 27 , 2013 , researchers at GSI from Lund University in Sweden reported confirming the existence of the element . On September 10 , 2013 , researchers from the same research group working in Darmstadt , Germany reported synthesis as well . # History # # Discovery profile # On February 2 , 2004 , synthesis of ununpentium was reported in ' ' Physical Review C ' ' by a team composed of Russian scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Laboratory . The team reported that they bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions to produce four atoms of ununpentium . These atoms , they report , decayed by emission of alpha-particles to ununtrium in approximately 100 milliseconds. : + + 3 n + The DubnaLivermore collaboration has strengthened their claim for the discovery of ununpentium by conducting chemical experiments on the decay daughter  268  Db . In experiments in June 2004 and December 2005 , the dubnium isotope was successfully identified by milking the Db fraction and measuring any SF activities . Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed  268  Db which lends support to the assignment of Z=115 to the parent nuclei . Sergei Dmitriev from the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions ( FLNR ) in Dubna , Russia , has formally put forward their claim of discovery of ununpentium to the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party ( JWP ) . In 2011 , the IUPAC evaluated the DubnaLivermore results and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery . # Naming # Ununpentium is historically known as ' ' eka-bismuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary IUPAC systematic element name derived from the digits 115 , where un- represents Latin ' ' unum ' ' . Pent- represents the Greek word for 5 . For more , see systematic element name . # Current and future experiments # The team at Dubna are currently running another series of experiments on the  243  Am (  48  Ca , xn ) reaction . They are attempting to complete the 4n excitation function and confirm the data for  287  Uup . They are also hoping to identify some decays from the 2n and 5n exit channels . This reaction will run until the Christmas shutdown . The FLNR also have future plans to study light isotopes of element 115 using the reaction  241  Am +  48  Ca . A team of researchers at Lund University announced they had corroborated the 2004 findings in August 2013 by shooting calcium ions into a thin film of americium . Researchers at the GSI Helmholtz in Darmstadt , Germany reported the successful synthesis of ununpentium using the same reaction just two weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Target-projectile combinations # The table below contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used to form compound nuclei with Z=115 .

This leads , in part , to relatively high yields from these reactions . ;  238  U (  51  V , ' ' x ' ' n )  289 ' ' x ' '  Uup There are strong indications that this reaction was performed in late 2004 as part of a uranium(IV) fluoride target test at the GSI . No reports have been published , suggesting that no product atoms were detected , as anticipated by the team . ;  243  Am (  48  Ca , ' ' x ' ' n )  291 ' ' x ' '  Uup ( x=2,3,4 ) This reaction was first performed by the team in Dubna in JulyAugust 2003 . In two separate runs , they were able to detect 3 atoms of  288  Uup and a single atom of  287  Uup . The reaction was studied further in June 2004 in an attempt to isolate the descendant  268  Db from the  288  Uup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 15 SF decays were measured with a lifetime consistent with  268  Db . In order to prove that the decays were from dubnium-268 , the team repeated the reaction in August 2005 and separated the +4 and +5 fractions and further separated the +5 fractions into tantalum-like and niobium-like ones . Five SF activities were observed , all occurring in the +5 fractions and none in the tantalum-like fractions , proving that the product was indeed isotopes of dubnium . In a series of experiments between October 2010 February 2011 , scientists at the FLNR studied this reaction at a range of excitation energies . They were able to detect 21 atoms of  288  Uup and one atom of  289  Uup , from the 2n exit channel . This latter result was used to support the synthesis of ununseptium . The 3n excitation function was completed with a maximum at 8 pb . The data was consistent with that found in the first experiments in 2003. # Isotopes and nuclear properties # # Chemical properties # # Extrapolated chemical properties # # #Oxidation states# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 ( VA ) in the Periodic Table , below bismuth . In this group , each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +V but with differing stability . For nitrogen , the +V state is very difficult to achieve due to the lack of low-lying d-orbitals and the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands . The +V state is well represented for phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony . However , for bismuth it is rare due to the reluctance of the 6s  2  electrons to participate in bonding . This effect is known as the inert pair effect and is commonly linked to relativistic stabilisation of the 6s-orbitals . It is expected that ununpentium will continue this trend and portray only +III and +I oxidation states . Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and ununpentium(I) is likely to show some unique properties . Because of spin-orbit coupling , flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties ; if this is the case , ununpentium will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  +  will have the same electron configuration as flerovium. # Chemistry # Ununpentium should display eka-bismuth chemical properties and should therefore form a sesquioxide , Uup  2  Oxygen # Stability # All the reported above isotopes of element 115 , obtained by nuclear collisions of lighter nuclei , are severely neutron-deficient , because the proportion of neutrons to protons needed for maximum stability increases with atomic number . The most stable isotope will probably be  299  Uup , with 184 neutrons , a known magic closed-shell number conferring exceptional stability , making it ( with one further proton outside the magic number of 114 protons ) both the chemical and the nuclear homolog of  209  Bi ; but the technology required to add the required neutrons presently does not exist . This is because no known combination of target and projectile can result in the required neutrons . It has been suggested that such a neutron-rich isotope could be formed by quasifission ( fusion followed by fission ) of a massive nucleus , multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would depend on the stability of the parent nuclei towards spontaneous fission ) .
