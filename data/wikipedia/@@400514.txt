The Doctor of Musical Arts degree ( D.M.A. , D.M. , D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D. ) is a doctoral academic degree in music . The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization ( usually music performance , composition , or conducting ) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history , music theory , or music pedagogy . The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete ( in addition to the masters and bachelors degrees ) , preparing students to be professional performers , conductors , and composers . As a terminal degree , the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university , college , and conservatory teaching/research positions . # Types # The D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance ( sometimes with a specialization in pedagogy and/or literature ) , composition , and conducting . Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title Doctor of Music ( D.M. or D.Mus. ) or Doctor of Arts ( D.A. ) or Doctor in Musical Studies ( Ph.D. ) instead of D.M.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Association of Schools of Music , who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952 . Northwestern University , the University of Michigan , and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A. Boston University offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955 . In 2005 , Boston University also expanded into online music education by launching the first online doctoral degree in music , a D.M.A. program ( along with a Master of Music program ) in music education . Several U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree today . The Ph.D . is generally considered to be more research oriented , while other doctorates may place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component . Such distinctions among degree types not always so clear-cut , however . For instance , most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written dissertation , regardless of degree designation . The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D . Also , music education Ph.D . programs may include performance-oriented tracks . In composition , one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard doctorate in music theory , musicology , music therapy , and ethnomusicology . A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music ( D.S.M. ) which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music , choral conducting and organ performance . # Components # D.M.A. students typically complete applied studies , such as lessons or mentoring with a professor , and take courses within their area of specialization . In many D.M.A. programs , all of the different D.M.A. streams ( e.g. , performance , composition , conducting ) take a common core of music theory and music history courses . Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a comprehensive exam on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory . The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a thesis , dissertation , or research project and the performance of recitals , usually including at least one lecture-recital . Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music , such as music history or performance practice , which contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance . Some institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals . For example , a student completing a D.M.A. in piano pedagogy may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university 's department of psychology ( e.g. , on the psychology of learning and memory ) ; a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of computer engineering ( e.g. , in computer programming ) . While teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs , most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree , either as a requirement of their **25;107960;TOOLONG package or as a part-time employee of the university . D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program , or , if they have multiple skill areas ( e.g. , a person with an M.Mus. in piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may teach in another area . # Admission requirements # To be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program , most institutions require a master 's degree , such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study , usually with a grade average of B+ or higher . D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recitali.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of stylesin addition to orchestral excerpts . Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element . Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions , including scores and recordings of live performances . Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school ( or similar ) teaching experience , and may further require an example of scholarly writing . Newly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history , theory , and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed . Often , the knowledge of a second language - one of languages of major influence in music history ( such as German , French , Italian , Spanish , or Russian ) - is required to complete the degree . The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the Graduate Record Examination ( GRE ) , a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math , vocabulary , and analytical writing . While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant 's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships , it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university . # Brief history # After World War II , there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level . As was the case with many occupations , the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces . The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college , causing a spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a spike in enrollment . In music education , universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians , but many , including those of international rank , lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors . Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities . The Nation 's renowned conservatories , such a Juilliard and Curtis , at the time , saw no need for the degree yet many alumni of those institutions , and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education . In 1952 , after six years of deliberation , the National Association of Schools of Music , NASM , approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided . The NASM was , and still is , the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the American Council on Education .
