The 2008 United States presidential election in Nebraska took place on November 4 , 2008 as part of the 2008 United States presidential election . Voters chose 5 electors to the Electoral College , who voted for President and Vice President . However , this state is one of the two states of the U.S. that , instead of giving all of its electors to the winner based on its statewide results , just 2 of them vote based on the statewide results , and the others vote based on their individual congressional district results . Nebraska , statewide , was not a swing state in 2008 . Located in the Great Plains of the United States , it is one of the most staunchly Republican states in the country . While some hypothetical general election match-up polls between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama showed the race to be seemingly close , they were largely regarded as outliers as more polls released showed McCain leading in double digits . McCain wound up carrying the popular vote in Nebraska by 14.93 points , taking in 56.53% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain in Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , which contains Omaha and the surrounding areas . Due to Nebraska 's system of proportionally allocating electoral votes , Obama was able to win one electoral vote while John McCain received the state 's other four electoral votes . # Primaries &amp; caucuses # *Nebraska Democratic caucuses , 2008 *Nebraska Republican primary , 2008 # Campaign statewide # # Polling # McCain won every single pre-election poll . Since May , he won each poll by a double digit margin of victory and each with at least 52% of the vote . # Fundraising # John McCain raised a total of $678,059 in the state , while Barack Obama raised $864,393. # Advertising and visits # Obama spent $55,807 while McCain and the Republican Trust PAC spent a total of just $1,225 . Both Obama and McCain visited the state once . Obama held a downtown rally at Omaha and McCain traveled to both Omaha and Ashland . Palin also visited Omaha once . # Campaign in Omaha # Nebraska has two electoral votes that go to the winner of the popular vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on whichever candidate wins the popular vote in each of Nebraska 's three congressional districts , all of which have trended Republican in the past elections . However Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , based in the city of Omaha , is significantly less conservative . The second CD of Nebraska was actually considered as a battleground area by some , leading the Obama campaign to open a single campaign office in Omaha with 15 staff members to cover the congressional district in September 2008 . More than 900 people attended the opening of those offices . Democratic Mayor Mike Fahey of Omaha said that he would do whatever it takes to deliver the electoral vote tied to the 2nd Congressional District to Obama , and the Obama Campaign considered Nebraska 's 2nd congressional district in play . Former Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and then senior U.S. Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama. # Analysis # Nebraska , part of the conservative Great Plains region , is one of the most Republican states in the nation . It has only gone Democratic in a presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain won the Cornhusker State by nearly 15 points . Obama was only able to win four counties : Douglas County , which contains Omaha ; Lancaster County , which contains the state capital of Lincoln and the University of Nebraska ; Saline County ; and Thurston County , which contains a Native American reservation and was the only county to be won by John Kerry in 2004 . No Democratic presidential nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson 's landslide 1964 victory has ever won more than four counties in Nebraska . In 2008 , McCain won Nebraska 's 1st Congressional District and Nebraska 's 3rd Congressional District by fairly safe margins , along with the state as a whole , but Obama managed to carry Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , based in Omaha , by a slim margin of 1,260 votes , resulting in one of Nebraska 's five electoral votes being awarded to Obama . This was a particularly notable win , because with Nebraska 's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote from Nebraska since 1964 . Obama did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Douglas and Lancaster . While John Kerry had lost these counties by double-digits , Obama was able to carve out small victories in a state he lost by a landslide . During the same election , Republicans held the open U.S. Senate seat vacated by Republican Chuck Hagel who retired . Former Republican Governor Mike Johanns easily defeated Democrat Scott Kleeb , a rancher , by 17.46 points . Johanns received 57.52% of the total vote while Kleeb took in 40.06% . At the state level , a candidate known to be a Republican picked up a seat in the nonpartisan and unicameral Nebraska Legislature in 2008. # Results # # Statewide # border= 1 cellpadding= 4 cellspacing= 0 style= margin : 1em 1em 1em 0 ; background : #f9f9f9 ; border : 1px #aaa solid ; border-collapse : collapse ; font-size : 95% ; ! colspan= 7 United States presidential election in Nebraska , 2008 ! colspan= 2 style= width : 15em Party ! style= width : 17em Candidate ! style= width : 17em Running mate ! style= width : 5em Votes ! style= width : 7em Percentage ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #FF3333 ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #3333FF ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #DDDDDD ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #D2B48C ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #999999 ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #FFCC00 ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #0BDA51 ; width : 3px # Congressional District # John McCain carried two of the states three congressional districts , while Barack Obama carried one congressional district held by a Republican . class=wikitable !

Nebraska is allocated 5 electors because it has 3 congressional districts and 2 senators . All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 5 electors , who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate . Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded 2 electoral votes , and the other 3 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President . Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate , they are not obligated to vote for them . An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector . The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15 , 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President . The Electoral College itself never meets as one body . Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols . The following were the 5 members of the Electoral College from the state . 4 of the electors were pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin ; 2 at large , 1 for each of the 1st and 3rd Congressional districts . 1 was pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden : * Charles Thone is an elector for Nebraska 's 1st congressional district pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin . * William Forsee is an elector for Nebraska 's 2nd congressional district pledged to Barack Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Nebraska 's 3rd congressional district pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin . * Norman Riffel is an at-large elector pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin . * Patricia Dorwart is an at-large elector pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin .
