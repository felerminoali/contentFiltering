Christopher Hugh Sykes FRSL ( 17 November 1907 &amp;ndash ; 8 December 1986 ) was an English author . Born into a well-off north-of-England landowning family , he was the second son of the diplomat Sir Mark Sykes ( 18791919 ) . His uncle , also Christopher Sykes , was , for a time , a close friend of Edward VII . Educated at Downside School and the University of Oxford ( Christ Church ) , Sykes was , for a time in his youth , in the Foreign Office , including a stint as an attach(192829) in the British Embassy in Berlin , where Harold Nicolson was then Counsellor . This was followed by a year ( 193031 ) at the British Legation in Teheran . An early hero was Aubrey Herbert , remembered now as the man who inspired John Buchan 's classic thriller , ' ' Greenmantle ' ' . Though Sykes thought of making politics his career , his stammer and also his artistic and imaginative disposition indicated that political life was not for him .

On their return to England , Sykes and Byron wrote a novel together under the name of Richard Waughburton , Innocence and Design , published in 1935 . A little later , Sykes and Cyril Connolly planned a book jointly with the title of ' ' The Little Voice ' ' . In common with other projects of Connolly 's , the book never got beyond the planning stages . Sykes published in 1936 a biography of the German Arabist Wilhelm Wassmus ; he did not , during later years , include this volume in his list of his publications . A memoir of Byron , killed at sea in 1941 , was included in Sykes ' bestselling book , ' ' Four Studies in Loyalty ' ' .

In this capacity he undertook extremely hazardous work with the French Resistance : an experience which , like his friendship with Byron , was depicted in ' ' Four Studies in Loyalty ' ' , this time in that book 's last chapter . Nowadays Sykes is especially remembered for his biography of his friend , Evelyn Waugh ( the two were both Catholics , but with the notable difference mentioned by Waugh 's son Auberon when reviewing Sykes 's book in the November 1975 issue of ' ' Books and Bookmen ' ' that whereas Waugh converted to Roman Catholicism in his twenties , Sykes was a cradle Catholic ) and , to a lesser extent , for his classic history of the British Mandate of Palestine , ' ' Crossroads to Israel ' ' ( 1965 ) .

After 1945 Sykes worked for many years in BBC Radio , as well as writing for several British and American periodicals , including ' ' The New Republic ' ' , ' ' The Spectator ' ' , ' ' Books and Bookmen ' ' , ' ' The Observer ' ' and the short-lived ' ' English Review Magazine ' ' .
