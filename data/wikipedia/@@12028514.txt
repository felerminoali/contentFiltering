After several close calls throughout the rest of the decade , and a thoroughly hard time at the hands of the record industry , she eventually saw chart action in 1969 , before mostly forgoing live performance in 1979 to concentrate on writing and production . She experienced a fashionable , Brit-led surge in cult popularity beginning in the 1990s and returned to live performance in mid-1998 . Sands is still actively recording and performing today . # Biography # Evie Sands was born Evelyn Lourette Sands in Brooklyn , New York , cutting her first singles by her mid-teens : The Roll / My Dog ( ABC 10458/1963 ) , Danny Boy I Love You So / I Was Moved . ( Gold 215/ 1964 ) . In 1965 Sands signed to the Blue Cat label of Red Bird Records ; she toured with Red Bird star act the Shangri-Las and began a lasting collaboration with the producer/composers Chip Taylor and Al Gorgoni with the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Trade Martin ) . Prior to its release , a test pressing of Sands ' recording was stolen by a Chicago-based producer , who shopped it to established Chess Records recording artist Jackie Ross , who was coming off the major pop/soul hit Selfish One . Ross who was unaware of the duplicity involved , and who left Chess shortly afterwards and her producers loved the song , and recorded , pressed and released the record within 48 hours , beating Sands ' version to the street by a week . Backed by the marketing and promotional muscle of Chess Records , and with Ross ' name attached , this version unsurprisingly received the lion 's share of airplay . The subsequent legal struggle set back Sands ' career before it had had a chance to get started . By the time Chess withdrew the Ross single from the marketplace , Sands ' version would only break through in the few cities ( like Los Angeles ) that had thus far stayed ' on the fence ' , waiting to see which version to play . Sands ' follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst the post Take Me chaos , leaving Brit invaders The Hollies clear to score a hit cover in the spring of 1966 . That same year , Sands debuted on Cameo-Parkway Records and would continue the pattern of songs introduced by Sands becoming successful for other artists , when in 1967 , Sands ' latest single , the Chip Taylor-penned Angel of the Morning , got caught up in label 's business problems . Despite the single being one of the most-requested radio songs wherever played , and the initial 10,000 copies selling out , the label 's pending bankruptcy aborted the record 's potential success ; a few months later , the unknown Merrilee Rush would score a Top Ten single with the song . Sands ' last single release on Cameo-Parkway was Billy Sunshine in January 1968 , the tracking reaching ' ' Billboard s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart before Cameo 's demise . In 1969 Sands scored with the A&amp;M single Any Way That You Want Me , a Chip Taylor composition previously recorded by both the American Breed and the Troggs in 1966 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Any Way That You Want Me also reached the Top Ten or better in Columbus , Ohio , Houston , Texas , San Diego , California , and a number of other cities ; it reached No. 53 ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot 100 , tying Don Ho 's Tiny Bubbles for longevity among 1960s singles failing to reach that chart 's top 50 ( at 17 weeks ) , and eventual sales are estimated at 500,000 units . Sands ' debut album , also named ' ' Any Way That You Want Me ' ' , was released on A&amp;M in 1970 , several months after the single had peaked . Evie made her recorded debut as a songwriter on the album with It 's This I Am - covered years later by Beck and Beth Orton , respectively . A Sands album to be produced by Val Garay for Buddah Records was announced in March 1971 but did not come to fruition : rather the 1975 release ' ' Estate of Mind ' ' on the Capitol Records Haven label ended Sands ' five-year absence from recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album marked Sands ' continuing as a songwriter , also collaborating with Richard Germinaro and veteran songwriter Ben Weisman . Two tracks from the album , Lambert and Potter 's You Brought The Woman Out Of Me and the Sands-Weisman-Germinaro collaboration I Love Makin ' Love To You , both approached major hit status . They wound up peaking at No. 50 , with Sands would see the latter included on the ' ' ButterFly ' ' album by Barbra Streisand . Several other Sands songs from the Estate of Mind album were also covered by a number of artists , including Dionne Warwick , Dobie Gray , Dusty Springfield , Frankie Valli , Gladys Knight , Arthur Prysock , The Manhattans , Cher/Gregg Allman , Jose Feliciano and Phyllis Hyman . After a final 1976 single release on Haven : a remake of The Way You Do the Things You Do , Sands next release was on RCA who issued the album ' ' Suspended Animation ' ' - produced by Sands and Michael Stewart in the spring of 1979 ; Sands had actually begun working with co-producer Michael Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members David Hungate , Steve Lukather and Greg Phillinganes , and also Lee Ritenour and Buzz Feiten , and the vocalists backing Sands included Toto frontman Bobby Kimball , Bill Champlin of Chicago and on the track Lady of the Night - Dusty Springfield . Despite its prestigious personnel ' ' Suspended Animation ' ' did n't make a real chart impact for its single releases and Sands focused mostly on writing and production in the music business for almost twenty years . As with her previous album , a few of the songs were covered by several artists , including Helen Reddy , Linda Clfford , Phyllis Hyman , June Pointer , The Weather Girls and Shirley Bassey . Karen Carpenter recorded two songs for her solo album , but they remained unreleased . In 1982 , Sands co-produced ( with Leslie Ann Jones ) the Holly Near album Speed Of Light . The basic band consisted of Adrienne Torf-keyboards , Carrie Barton-bass , Cam Davis-drums and Ray Obiedo- electric and acoustic guitars . Additional musicians and singers included , Sands-electric guitar , acoustic guitar and backing vocals , Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tillery-backing vocals . The album was recorded and mixed in San Francisco , California at The Automatt . In late 1996 , Sands went to see Chip Taylor perform at a club gig and he invited her onstage to perform with him . Despite not having kept actively in touch through the previous years , the experience was so successful that the two re-ignited their collaboration along with Al Gorgoni , resulting in the critically acclaimed ' ' Women In Prison ' ' LP , which was released in 1999 ( and again in 2000 ) on Taylor 's Train Wreck records . A more rootsy project than the blue-eyed soul of her late 1960s-1970s output , the album consisted of various Sands-Taylor-Gorgoni originals , including a duet with Lucinda Williams on the track Cool Blues Story . Several tracks fared well on UK/Euro indie charts . After the reconnection with Taylor , Sands returned to performing in 1998 . Sands and Taylor did some shows in the UK and Europe when the album was released , including London , Glasgow , Brussels and several dates in Holland . Sands ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Any Way ... ' ' and ' ' Estate ... ' ' were reissued in September 2005 and June 2006 respectively , on Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster 's Rev-Ola imprint in the United Kingdom . Evie can currently be found performing her own solo material as well as performing as the lead guitar player in eclectic Los Angeles based group , Adam Marsland 's Chaos Band . Her most recent recorded appearance is on that band 's 2007 live CD ' ' Long Promised Road : Songs of Dennis and Carl Wilson ' ' , on which she sings several lead vocals , including the first-ever released recording of Dennis Wilson 's Would n't It Be Nice to Live Again . She also did extensive vocal and guitar work on Marsland 's 2009 double CD ' ' Go West ' ' , including lead vocals on one track . # Discography # # Albums # * A&amp;M SP-4239 - ' ' Any Way That You Want Me ' ' - 1970 * Haven ST-9202 - ' ' Estate of Mind ' ' - 1974 * RCA Victor AFL1-2943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Train Wreck TW-009 - ' ' Women in Prison ' ' - 1999 # Singles # * ABC 10458 - The Roll/My Dog 1963 * Gold 215 - Danny Boy , I Love You So/I Was Moved 1964 * Blue Cat 118 - Take Me For A Little While/Run Home To Your Mama - 1965 * Blue Cat 122 - I Ca n't Let Go / Uptight 1965 * Cameo 413 - Picture Me Gone/It Makes Me Laugh - 1966 * Cameo 436 - The Love Of A Boy / We Know Better 1966 * Cameo 475 - Angel Of The Morning / Dear John 1967 * Cameo 2002 - Billy Sunshine / It Makes Me Laugh - 1967 * A&amp;M 0980 - Until It 's Time For You To Go / Shadow Of The Evening 1968 * A&amp;M 1026 - One Fine Summer Morning / I 'll Hold Out My Hand 1969 * A&amp;M 1090 - Any Way That You Want Me / I 'll Never Be Alone Again 1969 - Billboard Hot 100 #53 ( Aug. ) * A&amp;M 1157 - Maybe Tomorrow / Crazy Annie 1969 * A&amp;M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow 1970 - Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 #110 , Billboard AC #30 ( March ) * A&amp;M 1192 - It 's This I Am , I Find / Take Me For A Little While 1970 * Haven 7010 - You Brought The Woman Out Of Me/Early Morning Sunshine - 1974 - Billboard Hot 100 #50 ( March 1975 ) * Haven 7013 - I Love Makin ' Love To You/One Thing On My Mind - 1974 - Billboard Hot 100 #50 ( August 1975 ) * Haven 7020 - Yesterday Ca n't Hurt Me/ ( Am I ) Crazy Cause I Believe - 1975 - Billboard AC #36 ( Dec. ) * Haven 806 - The Way You Do The Things You Do/Love In The Afternoon - 1976 * RCA 11549 - Keep My Love Light Burnin ' / I Ca n't Wait For You - 1979 * RCA 11653 - You Sho ' Look Good To Me / Brain Damage 1979 # References # * * *
