In computer systems , an access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user , the user 's groups , the user 's privileges , and , in some cases , a particular application . # Overview # An ' ' access token ' ' is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread . A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity . While a token is generally used to represent only security information , it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created . Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege , for example to create a new token with lower levels of access rights to restrict the access of a launched application . An access token is used by Windows when a process or thread tries to interact with objects that have security descriptors ( ' ' securable objects ' ' ) . An access token is represented by the system object of type  Token  . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user logs on to the system and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database . The authentication database contains credential information required to construct the initial token for the logon session , including its user id , primary group id , all other groups it is part of , and other information . The token is attached to the initial process created in the user session and inherited by subsequent processes created by the initial process . Whenever such a process opens a handle to any resource which has access control enabled , Windows reconciles the data in the target object 's security descriptor with the contents of the current effective access token . The result of this access check evaluation is an indication of whether any access is allowed and , if so , what operations ( read , write/modify , etc. ) the calling application is allowed to perform . # Types of tokens # There are two types of tokens : ; Primary token : Primary tokens can only be associated to processes , and they represent a process 's security subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both privileged operations , requiring two different privileges in the name of privilege separation - the typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token , and a logon service associating it to the user 's operating system shell . Processes initially inherit a copy of the parent process 's primary token . ; Impersonation token : Impersonation is a security concept implemented in Windows NT that allows a server application to temporarily be the client in terms of access to secure objects . Impersonation has four possible levels : ' ' anonymous ' ' , giving the server the access of an anonymous/unidentified user , ' ' identification ' ' , letting the server inspect the client 's identity but not use that identity to access objects , ' ' impersonation ' ' , letting the server act on behalf of the client , and ' ' delegation ' ' , same as impersonation but extended to remote systems to which the server connects ( through the preservation of credentials ) . The client can choose the maximum impersonation level ( if any ) available to the server as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( impersonation initially was not , but historical carelessness in the implementation of client APIs failing to restrict the default level to identification , letting an unprivileged server impersonate an unwilling privileged client , called for it ) . Impersonation tokens can only be associated to threads , and they represent a ' ' client ' ' process 's security subject . Impersonation tokens are usually created and associated to the current thread implicitly , by IPC mechanisms such as DCE RPC , DDE and named pipes . # Contents of a token # A token is composed of various fields , including but not limited to : * an identifier . * the identifier of the associated logon session . The session is maintained by the authentication service , and is populated by the authentication packages with a collection of all the information ( credentials ) the user provided when logging in . Credentials are used to access remote systems without the need for the user to re-authenticate ( single sign-on ) , provided that all the systems involved share an authentication authority ( e.g. a Kerberos ticket server ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and it 's strictly read-only. * the identifiers of groups the user ( or , more precisely , the subject ) is part of . Group identifiers can not be deleted , but they can be disabled . At most one of the groups is designated as the ' ' session id ' ' , a volatile group representing the logon session , allowing access to volatile objects associated to the session , such as the display . * the restricting group identifiers ( optional ) . This additional set of groups does n't grant additional access , but further restricts it : access to an object is only allowed if it 's allowed ' ' also ' ' to one of these groups . Restricting groups can not be deleted nor disabled . Restricting groups are a recent addition , and they are used in the implementation of sandboxes. * the privileges , i.e. special capabilities the user has . Most privileges are disabled by default , to prevent damage from non-security-conscious programs . Starting in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 privileges can be permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  with the  SEPRIVILEGEREMOVED  attribute . * the default owner , primary group and ACL for objects created by the subject associated to the token .
