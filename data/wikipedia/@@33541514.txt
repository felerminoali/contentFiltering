The Stanford rugby teams of 1906 to 1917 represented Stanford University as the school 's only football program during those years , replacing American football with rugby union . The school had played American football from 1892 to 1905 , but in 1906 , concerned with the growing levels of violence in football , Stanford and other universities changed to rugby . Stanford played twelve seasons of rugby , during which it played other college teams , club teams from the United States , Canada , and Australia , as well as the New Zealand national team and Australia national team . Despite the team 's success , it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers , and after rival California returned to football in 1915 , Stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents ; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to World War I , the school returned to American football in 1919. # Switch to rugby # American football in the early 1900s had become increasingly violent ; with no forward pass , the ball carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries . In 1905 , 18 deaths , three at the college level , were attributed to football ; 159 serious injuries were also reported , 88 at the college level . Reform was demanded by such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt , who decried the brutality and foul play of the game , and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue . As a result , before the next season began , new rules were put in place to discourage such play . The forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations . Despite the planned changes , a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year , including Columbia , NYU , and Northwestern . Several universities on the West Coast , led by California and Stanford , replaced the sport with rugby . At the time , the future of football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide .

However , due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway , East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing football . With no nationwide movement , the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small . The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia , New Zealand , and especially , due to its proximity , Canada . The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby , with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays , with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy . # Return to football # In 12 seasons of rugby , Stanford was remarkably successful : the team had three undefeated seasons , three one-loss seasons , and an overall record of 94 wins , 20 losses , and 3 ties for a winning percentage of .816 .

Students and alumni began to clamor for a return to football to allow wider intercollegiate competition . The pressure at rival California was stronger ( especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped ) , and in 1915 California returned to football . As reasons for the change , the school cited football rule changes , the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play football , interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools , and a patriotic desire to play an American game . California 's return to football increased the pressure on Stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry . Stanford played its 1915 , 1916 , and 1917 Big Games as rugby against Santa Clara and California 's football Big Game in those years was against Washington , but both schools desired to restore the old traditions . The onset of World War I gave Stanford an out : in 1918 , the Stanford campus was designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , Nevada , and Utah , and the commanding officer , Sam M.

After the war , Stanford resumed its football program and relegated rugby to a minor sport . Several Stanford rugby players who played during those yearsincluding Daniel Carroll , Dink Templeton , Morris Kirksey , Erwin Righter , John Patrick , and Charles Doewent on to win a gold medal for the United States in rugby at the 1920 Summer Olympics . # Season results # # 1906 season # In its first season of rugby , Stanford retained head football coach James F.
