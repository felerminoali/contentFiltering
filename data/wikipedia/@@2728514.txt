The locomotives of India presently consist of electric and diesel locomotives . Steam locomotives are no longer used in India , except in heritage trains . Locomotives are also called ' ' locos ' ' or ' ' engines ' ' . The Bengal Sappers of the Indian Army were the first to run a steam locomotive in India . The steam locomotive named Thomason ran with two wagons for carrying earth from Roorkee to Piran Kaliyar in 1851 , two years before the first passenger train ran from Bombay to Thane in 1853. # Classification of Locomotives # In India , locomotives are classified according to their track gauge , motive power , the work they are suited for and their power or model number . The class name includes this information about the locomotive . It comprises 4 or 5 letters . The first letter denotes the track gauge . The second letter denotes their motive power ( Diesel or Electric ) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited ( goods , passenger , mixed or shunting ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . However , from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted . Under this system , for newer diesel locomotives , the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range . Electric locomotives do n't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered . For them this letter denotes their model number as usual . A locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype . This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series , perhaps different motors , or a different manufacturer . With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives ( as mentioned above ) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments : ' A ' for 100 hp , ' B ' for 200 hp , ' C ' for 300 hp , etc . So in this scheme , a WDP-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco , while a WDM-3F would be a 3600 hp loco . ' ' Note : This classification system does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-functional now . They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class .

The designs were revised in 1905 and 1906 with additional types added due to requests for heavier and more powerful locomotives : * Class SP Standard Passenger 4-4-0 ; * Class SG Standard Goods 0-6-0 ; * Class PT Passenger Tank 2-6-4T ; * Class HP Heavy Passenger 4-6-2 ; * Class AP Atlantic Passenger 4-4-2 ; * Class HG Heavy Goods 2-8-0 ; * Class HT Heavy Tank 2-8-2T . These BESA designs however were advisory , not mandatory , and were customised by the railway companies to their own taste . The railway companies could not even agree to use the same classification system : only the state operated railways used the class designations SP , SG , PT , HP , AP , HG and HT . Once superheating became accepted , superheated versions were classified SPS , SGS , etc. if built with superheaters , and SPC , SGC , etc. if converted from saturated to superheated. # #Indian Railways Standards ( IRS ) designs# # After World War I , new , larger , more powerful locomotives were designed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to appear from 1927 onwards : * Class XA branch passenger 4-6-2 design , 12.5-ton axleload ; * Class XB light passenger 4-6-2 design , 17-ton axleload ; * Class XC heavy passenger 4-6-2 design , 19.5-ton axleload ; * Class XD light goods 2-8-2 design , 17-ton axleload ; * Class XE heavy goods 2-8-2 design , 22.5-ton axleload ; * Class XF light shunting 0-8-0 design , 18-ton axleload ; * Class XG heavy shunting 0-8-0 design , 23-ton axleload ; * Class XH 4-cylinder 2-8-2 , 28-ton axleload ( none built ) ; * Class XP experimental passenger 4-6-2 , 18.5-ton axleload ; * Class XS experimental 4-cylinder 4-6-2 , 21.5-ton axleload ; * Class XT light tank 0-4-2T , 15-ton axleload. # #World War II designs# # During World War II , large numbers of 2-8-2 locomotives were acquired from the United States and Canada , and were designated as classes AWD and CWD respectively . Several USATC S160 Class locomotives were adapted for broad gauge and became class AWC. # #Indian Government Railways ( IGR ) standard designs# # Shortly before World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them came into service . These new designs were signalled by the change of broad gauge prefix from ' X ' to ' W ' . In addition , plans were put into place to start manufacturing locomotives in India . The new classes were : * Class WP passenger 4-6-2 , 18.5-ton axleload ; * Class WG goods 2-8-2 , 18.5-ton axleload ; * Class WL ( 1st ) light 4-6-2 , 16-ton axleload ( four for North Western Railway in 1939 ; all to Pakistan at Partition ) ; * Class WL ( 2nd ) light 4-6-2 , 16.75-ton axleload ; * Class WM 2-6-4T , 16.25-ton axleload ; * Class WT 2-8-4T , 18-ton axleload ; * Class WU 2-4-2T , 16.5-ton axleload ; * Class WV 2-6-2T , 16.25-ton axleload ; * Class WW 0-6-2T , 16.5-ton axleload .
