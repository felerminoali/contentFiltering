This area of fertile land with many market gardens was referred to as ' Old Market ' from the 15th century . In the 13th century , the area was enclosed by a defensive ditch , with Lawfords Gate at the eastern end separating it from West Street . The ditch marked the boundary of the town of Bristol . The area was characterised by long narrow plots of land , some of which survive today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local taxes , and became a place of inns , low lodgings , squatters and outlaws . Old Market Street prospered as Bristols trade grew , developing into a 370 m long street connecting the East Gate of the Castle with Lawfords Gate , wide in its middle section and narrowing for the gates . In the 15th and 16th century , the area grew in importance and became the site of almshouses and manufacture , as well as houses , inns and shops . Old Market did not fare well in the English Civil War . During the Parliamentarian attack on Lawfords Gate , much of West Street may have been destroyed , and buildings to the east of Lawfords Gate may have been demolished to give the Royalists a clear defensive line of fire . Following the Civil War much of the area was redeveloped . The Castle was demolished and with it the East Gate ; Old Market Street and Castle Street became a major commercial axis . Many of the buildings erected during this period survive today . In 1768 , Lawfords Gate was demolished , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into West Street . Old Market became home to a widening range of trades . In Old Market Street and West Street the well-off built town houses ; in the side streets leading off to either side the artisans crowded in . By the end of the 19th century , market trading was becoming increasingly difficult due to the increase in wheeled traffic . Old Market became an important tram terminus , serving areas to the east , north-west and south of the city . By now it was also a well-established shopping street , connecting seamlessly with Castle Street . Parts of the area were affected by slum clearance programmes in the 1930s , but it was the severance caused by the destruction of Castle Street together with the building of Temple Way Underpass ( which obliterated the western end of Old Market Street ) that sent the area into near-terminal decline . Some businesses relocated to Broadmead ; others closed . Large parts of the area were zoned for redevelopment , and the area was severely blighted . In the 1970s , the value of what remained started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Conservation Area . Since then many of its at-risk buildings have been restored , and a more sensitive approach to development has done much to improve the area . # Significant buildings # Old Market contains over 60 listed buildings , some dating from before the 17th century .

It was held in the open air under an ancient oak tree , the site of which the Stag and Hounds Public House was built on . There is no actual record of when the court moved into the inn , where it was reputedly held in the first-floor room . It is believed that this was the last active Court of Piepowders , being abolished by the Courts Act 1971 .
