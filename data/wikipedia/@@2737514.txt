The Barmakids ( ' ' Barmakyn ' ' ; - ' ' al-Barmikah ' ' , from the Sanskrit : ' ' pramukha ' ' leader , chief administrator , registrar ) ; also wrongly called Barmecides ( philologically , the third syllable contains an unvoiced velar , not a sibilant ) were an influential family from Balkh in Bactria where they were originally Buddhists , and subsequently came to great political power under the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad . Khalid , the son of Barmak became the Prime Minister or ' ' Wazir ' ' of Al Saffah , the first Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty . His son Yahya aided Harun Al-Rashid in capturing the throne and rose to power as the most powerful man in the Empire . The Barmakids were remarkable for their majesty , splendor and hospitality . They are mentioned in some stories of the ' ' Arabian Nights ' ' . # Origins # The family is traceable back to the hereditary Buddhist administrators , Sanskrit Pramukha ( Arabized to Barmak ) , of the Buddhist monastery of Nava Vihra ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes considered the Barmakids to have been Zoroastrian priests before converting to Islam , an erroneous view based on the fact that Balkh was known as an important centre of Zoroastrianism , or from a simple failure of early Islamic sources to distinguish Zoroastrians from Buddhists . In fact , the Barmakids descended from the chiefs , or administrators of the Buddhist monastery called Navavihra ( Skt. ) or New Monastery , that was described by the Chinese Buddhist diarist Xuanzang in the seventh century which may have led to the Persian and Arabic error of thinking that the term Nowbahr was the name of a Zoroastrian fire temple headed by the Barmakids as reported in Islamic sources . The Pramukhas converted during the Arab invasion of the Sasanian Empire . The Barmakids were highly educated , respected and influential throughout Arabia , Persia , Central Asia and the Levant . In Baghdad , the Barmakid court became a centre of patronage for the Ulema , poets , scholars alike . Khalid ibn Barmak occupied distinguished positions under first two Abbasid Caliphs , al-Saffah and al-Mansur . He had risen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abul Jahm . Khalid was on such intimate terms with al-Saffah that his daughter was nursed by the wife of the Caliph . Likewise , Caliph 's daughter was nursed by Khalid 's wife . His son , Yahya ibn Barmak , at one time Governor of Arminiya , was entrusted by Caliph al-Mahdi ( 775-85 ) with the education of his son , Harun , the future Caliph al-Rashid . Under Abbasid regime Khalid rose to the headship of the department of Finance ( ' ' diwan al-Kharaj ' ' ) This department was concerned with Taxation and Land Tenure . Genuine budgets began to be drawn up for the first time and offices sprang up for various departments . The extensive staff of officials engaged in correspondence with the provinces and prepared estimates and accounts . An influential stratum of officialdom , the Irano-Islamic class of secretaries ( ' ' kuttab ' ' in Arabic , ' ' dabiran ' ' in Persian ) , was formed which considered itself as the main support of the state . Their knowledge of the complex system of the ' ' kharaj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of the quality of the land but of the produce of the crops sown , made the officials of the ' ' diwan al-Kharaj ' ' ; the guardians of knowledge which was inaccessible to the uninitiated and was passed by inheritance . In 765 , Khalid ibn Barmak received the governorship of Tabaristan , where he crushed a dangerous uprising . During his governorship of Upper Mesopotamia , Khalid , through a mix of firmness and justice , brought the province quickly into order and effectively curbed the unruly Kurds . # Influence under the early Abbasids # The Barmakid family was an early supporter of the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyads and of As-Saffah . This gave Khalid bin Barmak considerable influence , and his son Yahya ibn Khalid Many Barmakids were patrons of the sciences , which greatly helped the propagation of Indian science and scholarship into the Islamic world of Baghdad and beyond . They patronized scholars such as Gebir and Jabril ibn Bukhtishu. # Disgrace and fall # In 803 , the family lost favor in the eyes of Harun al-Rashd , and many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harun al-Rashd found his chief pleasure in the society of his sister Abbasa and Jafar bin Yahya , and , in order that these two might be with him continuously without breach of the restrictions on women , he persuaded them to contract a purely formal marriage . The condition , however , was that the two can meet only in his presence , so that they may not produce an heir . This not being observed , and Harun learning that Abbasa had borne a son , he caused Ja'far suddenly to be arrested and beheaded , and the rest of the family except Muammad , Yahya 's brother , to be imprisoned and deprived of their property . However , al-Tabari and Ibn Khaldn mentioned other reasons ensuring that their decline was gradual and not sudden . Their hypotheses are : *The Barmakids ' extravagance in spending to the extent that they overshadowed Hrun al-Rashid . It has been said that Jafar ibn Yahya built a mansion that cost twenty million dirhams and that his father , Yahya ibn Khalid , had gold tiles on the wall of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , whenever he passed an impressive house or mansion , they told him it belonged to the Barmakids. *al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi , an Abbasid loyal civil servant very close to Hrun and a rival of the Barmakids , convinced Hrn to assign spies to watch them , and that is how he found out about Yahya Ibn Abdullah al-Talibi 's incident . *The Barmakid Army : Although technically this army was under the Abbasids , in reality , the soldiers gave allegiance to al-Fadl Ibn Yahya al-Barmaki , Ja'far 's brother ; it numbered 50,000 soldiers . During their last days , al-Fadl ordered 20 thousand of them to come to Baghdad and claimed to create a legion under the name of the Karnabiya Legion . This made Harun very wary of their intentions . *The Governor of Khurasan at the time , Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan , sent a letter to Harun reporting about the unrest in his province and blaming Musa ibn Yahya , another brother of Ja'far , for it . *The Yahya ibn Abdullah al-Talibi incident : In AH 176 , Yahya ibn Abdullah went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place of Hrn . Many people followed him , and he became strong enough to cause unrest for the Abbasids . Hrn managed to capture him and ordered that he be confined to house arrest at al-Fadl 's house in Baghdad . However , al-Fadl , rather than making sure he would not escape , gave him money and a ride and let him leave Baghdad . The Abbasids considered that to be high treason . # Legacy # A number of canals , mosques and other public works owe their existence to the initiative and munificence of the Barmakids . Al Fadl , son of Yahya bin barmak is credited with being the first to introduce the use of lamps in the mosques during the holy month of Ramadan . They are also credited with the establishment of the first paper mill in Baghdad . Ja'far , another son of Yahya acquired great fame for eloquence , literary activity and pen-manship . Hitti argues that chiefly because of him , Arab historians regard the Barmakids as the founders of the class designated as ' people of the pen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long neck which Barmakids possessed is said to have been responsible for the introduction of the custom of wearing high collars . The first extant Arabic report on India was prepared under the directions of Yahya ibn Barmak ( d. 805 ) by his envoy . Barmaks were responsible for inviting several scholars and physicians from India to the court of Abbasids . When Sindh was attacked by the Arabs during the Battle of Rajasthan ; the city of Brahmanabad/Mansura was built by a Barmak . Later he was commissioned with building the capital of Baghdad . On 30 July 763 , the caliph Al Mansur concluded the construction of the city . It is said that the Baghdadi capital had numerous Indian architectural influences , now largely ignored by historians . # See also # * Hindu and Buddhist contribution to science in medieval Islam # Notes # # References # * *
