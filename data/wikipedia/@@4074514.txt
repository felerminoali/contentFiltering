My Love is a 1965 single release by Petula Clark which in early 1966 became an international hit , reaching #1 in the US : the track continued Clark 's collaboration with songwriter and record producer Tony Hatch . In November 1965 Tony Hatch , on a flight from London to Los Angeles , was putting the finishing touches on his composition The Life and Soul of the Party which he planned to record with Clark in Los Angeles to serve as her next single . In casual conversation with the American sitting next to him Hatch was advised that this song 's title would be meaningless to the American public . Hatch then proceeded to write lyrics for a song whose title - My Love - could not conceivably present any comprehension issue : the lyrics were completed during the flight and Hatch completed the music soon after landing in Los Angeles . My Love was recorded at Western Studios and featured the backing of the Wrecking Crew .
