The 2011 Singapore Grand Prix , formally the 2011 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix , was a Formula One motor race that was held on 25 September 2011 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore . It was the fourteenth round of the 2011 Formula One season , and the twelfth time the Singapore Grand Prix had been held . The race , contested over 61 laps , was won by Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel , the drivers ' championship leader , after starting from pole position . Jenson Button finished in second place for McLaren , and Mark Webber completed the podium in third position . As a consequence of the race , Vettel extended his lead in the World Drivers ' Championship to 124 points over Button , who moved up to second place in the championship . Fernando Alonso and Webber , third and fourth in the championship , were eliminated from championship contention . In the World Constructors ' Championship , Red Bull extended their championship lead over McLaren to 138 points , with Ferrari a further 85 points behind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the championship title . # Report # # Background # The build-up to the race was marked by accusations that Red Bull Racing had violated the Resource Restriction Agreement in , accusations that the team denied . The RRA is an agreement between members of the Formula One Teams Association designed to cut costs within the sport . The agreement outlines the teams ' projected budgets including both financial and non-financial elements , such as the amount of time spent using a wind tunnel for upcoming seasons and limits them to using only as much as they had agreed upon . Following an audit from a Dutch consultancy firm , it was reported that Red Bull had violated the RRA when other teams including McLaren , Ferrari , Mercedes and Sauber had passed the inspection . Vitantonio Liuzzi was handed a five-place grid penalty for the race for causing an accident on the first lap of the . His HRT team added a tribute to Christian Bakkerud onto their cars after Bakkerud , who raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice for HRT principal Colin Kolles ' team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scuderia Toro Rosso inadvertently broke one of its curfews when team principal Franz Tost arrived at the circuit too early . Because the Singapore Grand Prix is a night race , it starts at 10pm local time instead of 2pm as the European races do , meaning that the timetable of events is different for the duration of the Grand Prix weekend . The curfew period is officially defined as the nine hours before the first practice session , and therefore takes up daylight hours at Singapore instead of the early-morning hours in Europe . As Tost entered the circuit before the curfew had expired , the team were considered to have used up one of the four waivers to the curfew that all teams were allocated for 2011 . Red Bull , Mercedes and Virgin all fell afoul of the different timetable on the Saturday morning . All three teams later had their curfew exemptions restored after they demonstrated that the early staff members who originally broke the curfew were not involved with working on their cars . Tyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option compound , as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the medium compound as the prime . A single DRS ( Drag Reduction System ) Zone was used in the race . The detection point was located at turn 4 with the DRS activation point 35m after the turn 5 apex . This resulted in plenty of passing into the turn 7 braking zone . The race marked the 50th Grand Prix of Sbastien Buemi , who made his debut at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix , and was Sebastian Vettel 's 50th race for Red Bull . # Free Practice # The first practice session was delayed by half an hour to allow for circuit repairs to take place . Competitors in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia support races dislodged plastic kerbing on Republic Boulevard and Esplanade Drive , forcing the Grand Prix practice session to be delayed while the offending parts were removed and the circuit deemed safe . When the circuit was re-opened , the practice session was shortened to one hour instead of the prescribed ninety minutes . Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a second faster than his team-mate Mark Webber . Webber had previously had an on-track encounter with Timo Glock that destroyed his front wing and gave Glock a puncture , which ended his session . The session was interrupted several minutes later when Heikki Kovalainen 's Lotus T128 caught fire in almost exactly the same place that his car caught alight in 2010 . The session was stopped while Kovalainen 's car was retrieved , and restarted , only to be stopped again ten minutes from the end of the hour . Felipe Massa had hit a kerb , dislodging it and exposing the bolt that was supposed to secure it in place . The session restarted with three minutes remaining , before the circuit was repaired ahead of the second practice session . Fernando Alonso was fourth , followed by Jenson Button and Massa . Narain Karthikeyan drove the HRT for the first time since Valencia in this session , in preparation for his drive at his home race in India . He finished the session 24th and last , one tenth slower than teammate Daniel Ricciardo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second practice session with kerbing at Turn 13 removed . When the lights went green , the Lotus mechanics were still trying to rebuild Kovalainen 's car . Jenson Button 's session ended prematurely when he locked his brakes and stopped just before the wall at Turn 14 , and was unable to restart the car ; however , the time he had recorded until then was fast enough to be tenth overall at the end of the session . Sbastien Buemi 's session was also ended early , when he collided with the barriers at Turn 21 , going too fast through the corner and damaging his suspension . Team-mate Jaime Alguersuari also had little running before a mechanical problem ended his session , while Paul di Resta 's session was also shortened after a hydraulic brakes issue limited him to eight laps in the session . Vitaly Petrov had been scheduled to run upgraded bodywork parts on his Renault R31 , but the team discovered the car overheated , and were forced to abandon the new parts until Suzuka . Vettel set the quickest time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massa , Webber and Michael Schumacher completing the top six . Circuit repairs took place overnight in an effort to improve the kerbing and prevent the race weekend from being further disrupted . The kerbs at Turn 3 and Turn 7 were removed entirely , and replaced with painted markings , with the drivers to be briefed on what would be considered an acceptable racing line through the affected corners . The kerb at the entry to Turn 14 was likewise removed , but with no further plans to replace it , while efforts were made to secure the kerbs at Turn 13 and the Singapore Sling chicane . The FIA was unwilling to commit to one definitive plan , instead opting to reassess the situation once the initial work had been completed and again after the third practice session . The drivers expressed indifference towards the changes , with Felipe Massa commenting that it 's not a big change having or not having it , though he did point out that several drivers felt the kerbs at Turn 13 were unnecessary and that the FIA should consider the kerbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Qualifying # Qualifying was marked by a distinct spread across the grid , with several teams reproducing similar times between their drivers , comfortably separated from other teams . Sebastian Vettel was fastest in the first period , half a second clear of Jenson Button . As the session drew on , it became clear that several teams were in danger of being eliminated . Vitaly Petrov spent most of the session in 18th , and improved on his final run , but team mate Bruno Senna was faster and relegated Petrov on his final lap . Petrov blamed a small error for compromising his run , briefly losing control of the back end of the car just enough to change his tyre pressures and costing him the tenth of a second he would have needed to advance to Q2 . Senna claimed he had been impeded by Jaime Alguersuari on his flying lap , but the incident was not investigated . Heikki Kovalainen qualified ahead of Jarno Trulli , followed by the Virgins of Timo Glock and Jrme d'Ambrosio and the Hispanias of Daniel Ricciardo out-qualifying Vitantonio Liuzzi for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for causing a collision on the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix two weeks previously , but made no effect to his grid position of 24th . The second session was red-flagged when Kamui Kobayashi crashed at the Turn 10 chicane . Missing the first apex , his Sauber C30 was launched into the air by the kerb on the second apex , throwing him into the barriers . Qualifying was halted while the car was retrieved and debris from the crash cleared away . Kobayashi 's crash meant that he would fail to set a lap time and would start from seventeenth on the grid . When the session was restarted , Vettel once ageain led the way . Lewis Hamilton attempted a second flying lap during the session , but was forced to pit almost straight away when he picked up a puncture in his right-rear tyre . Under the sporting regulations , Hamilton would not be allowed to replace the damaged set of tyres with a fresh one , thereby depriving him of a set of option tyres for the race . Kobayashi 's team-mate Sergio Prez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Q3 , but was knocked out at the last moment by Paul di Resta ; the Mexican driver qualified eleventh ahead of the Williams pair of Rubens Barrichello and Pastor Maldonado . Sbastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari were fourteenth and sixteenth for Scuderia Toro Rosso , split by the lone Renault of Bruno Senna . Although , this made it the first time since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix that both Force Indias had made it into Q3 . The third session began with four drivers queueing at the end of pit lane , an unusual sight in Formula One , as they would all be running in the dirty air generated by the cars in front . However , with a full lap of the Marina Bay circuit taking almost two minutes to complete , the drivers would have to race get back to the pits on their in-lap if they intended to make a second run . Jenson Button led Fernando Alonso , Felipe Massa and Hamilton out of the pits . Hamilton later faced criticism for an aggressive move on Felipe Massa at Turn 19 on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compromising his flying lap as speed carried into the final corner would translate into a faster lap time . Massa questioned why Hamilton felt the need for such an aggressive move as opposed to slowing on his out-lap to allow for clear running . Force India also received criticism when both their drivers again elected to stay in the pits rather than set a flying lap ; Mercedes ' Michael Schumacher followed a similar approach , but did leave the pits in order to line up ahead of them . Sebastian Vettel , who had waited in pit for the queue of cars to clear , once again rose to provisional pole . Jenson Button was second until Hamilton and Mark Webber claimed second in succession . Button took third from Hamilton with his second flying lap , but Hamilton was held in the pits with a fuel problem long enough that he would not have enough time to navigate the circuit and get back to the start line before the chequered flag fell , and he had to settle for fourth . Alonso and Massa were fifth and sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap time in seventh . Vettel attempted to set a second lap time , but made a mistake and aborted the lap ; however , his original time was still fast enough for pole position , his eleventh of the season . The end result meant that the Red Bull cars occupied the first row of the grid , the McLarens the second , with both Ferraris on the third row , Mercedes completing the fourth and the Force Indias the fifth row . # Race # At the start , Vettel kept his lead into the first corner , while teammate Webber fell to fourth . Hamilton tried to take Webber after a good start for third place , but had to back out and fell to seventh . Button and Alonso 's good starts put them into second and third in the race . There was contact between Massa and Rosberg at Turn 1 forcing Rosberg to run straight across Turn 2 and filter in just behind Webber ; he conceded the place back to Massa later in the lap . Ricciardo also made contact , forcing him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumacher on lap 4 , repassing him on the run to Turn 7 , before passing Rosberg for sixth on the next lap . On Lap 10 , Glock crashed at the final turn , and retired with rear suspension damage ; whilst on the same lap Webber dived down Alonso 's outside into Turn 14 , Alonso then ran a bit wide allowing Webber to come down the outside again and take the position from him with a bold move at Turn 16 . Alonso pitted on the next lap , switching from the option to the prime tyres . Meanwhile , Hamilton and Massa both pitted on lap 12 , Ferrari winning the pit stop battle and with Massa staying in fifth place , and Alonso emerging at Turn 1 just in front of the pair , despite being held up by Barrichello . Alonso would also move back ahead of Webber , when Webber made his pit stop . Hamilton attacked immediately on the out lap and made contact with Massa at turn 7 . When Hamilton tried to go around the outside of the corner , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing both drivers Massa with a right rear puncture , dropping him down to nineteenth , and Hamilton for a new front wing to pit again . Hamilton was later given a drive through penalty for causing an avoidable collision . Behind Vettel and Button , di Resta had moved into third , after running a different strategy to the majority of his rivals . He kept this place until lap 19 , when he conceded it to Alonso at Turn 7 . He pitted not long after this , and fell to eighth behind teammate Sutil . Webber closed up behind Alonso and was half a second behind by lap 25 , before Alonso pitted for the second time . Rosberg ran wide at the final corner on lap 29 , which allowed Prez and Schumacher to close up on Rosberg . Prez took the defensive line for Turn 7 , and Schumacher attempted to go around the outside . Prez held the racing line , and Schumacher ran into the back of him , scattering debris across the track . Schumacher later described the incident as a racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brake as early as he did . Schumacher retired while Prez continued on relatively unscathed . The safety car was deployed while the debris was cleared , with many drivers electing to make pit stops , and as a result Vettel 's lead of more than 20 seconds was wiped out . At the restart , Vettel immediately pulled out a 4 second lead over second placed Button , who was stuck behind a train of backmarkers led by Jarno Trulli . Trulli was lapped by Kobayashi at Turn 1 while Button attempted to get past them . Webber passed Alonso down the inside into the Singapore Sling chicane , later describing the manoeuvre as spectacular . Martin Brundle also described the overtake , as opportunistic . Even despite this overtake , Webber was already five seconds behind Button . Meanwhile , Hamilton began his recovery following his drive through penalty , and was up to sixth place on lap 38 , before passing di Resta the following lap . Kobayashi was later given a drive-through penalty for ignoring blue flags , when Button had been stuck behind for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gearbox failure on lap 46 . Webber pitted and changed to the option tyre on lap 48 , and was temporarily overtaken by Hamilton . Button pitted the next lap and changed to another set of option tyres . This allowed Vettel to cover Button , and he pitted the next lap . As he exited the pits , the Lotus of Heikki Kovalainen was released into his path but he drove past Kovalainen in the pit lane exit . Alonso also made his stop on the same lap as Vettel , leaving him behind Webber this time . With seven laps to go , Hamilton passed di Resta once again for fifth place , as team-mate Button set the race 's fastest lap . Massa also managed to get back into the points after his clash with Hamilton , as he passed Barrichello and Prez to move into ninth . McLaren were still trying to pressure Vettel , and Button closed the gap to under fround seconds by the time Vettel had cleared lapped traffic . Unfortunately for him , Button also had to clear this traffic , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Alguersuari crashed at turn 18 on the penultimate lap , ending his day , but classified in 21st . Vettel was caught behind the Massa-Prez scrap for ninth on the final lap as Button backed out of his fight for victory . Massa missed the chance to take eighth from Sutil by having to let Vettel through . Thus , Vettel took his third successive victory , leading from lights-to-flag for the first time since the 2010 European Grand Prix . He was followed over the line by Button , who was only 1.7 seconds behind by the end of the race , and took his fourth podium in a row . Webber completed the podium followed by Alonso and Hamilton . Di Resta scored his best finish in Formula One with sixth place , ahead of Rosberg , Sutil , Massa and Prez , who rounded out the points . # Post-race # The result of the race meant that Vettel had not already won his second World Championship ; but , with Hamilton failing to beat Vettel , Alonso failing to stand on the podium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers were eliminated from Championship contention . Button became the only man who could stop Vettel now , finishing second in the race and moving up to second place in the Drivers ' Championship . He was 124 points behind Vettel , with only 125 points still available , which meant that even if Button won all of the remaining races , Vettel needed just one tenth place to retain his world title . This result also meant it was possible for Red Bull to clinch their second successive Constructors ' world title in Japan , by scoring 34 points more than McLaren . Massa expressed frustration with Hamilton , publically criticising him after the race . He was already annoyed at Hamilton , following an incident in qualifying where Hamilton lunged down Massa 's inside , attempting to pass on an out-lap . Massa also went up to Hamilton in the post-race TV interview area as he was about to start an interview with RTL Television , patted his shoulder , and sarcastically said : Good job , bro. # Classification # # Qualifying # Notes : : Adrian Sutil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit in Q3 , while Michael Schumacher only drove an out-lap , so they did not set a lap time . : Kamui Kobayashi crashed on his out-lap in Q2 , and so failed to set a lap time . : Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a five-place grid penalty for causing the first-corner accident at the , although ultimately it had no effect as he qualified last anyway . # Race # Notes : : Jaime Alguersuari crashed on lap 60 of the race , but was classified as he had completed over 90% of the winner 's race distance . # Championship standings after the race # ; Drivers ' Championship standings ; Constructors ' Championship standings class= wikitable style= font-size : 95% ; ! ! !
