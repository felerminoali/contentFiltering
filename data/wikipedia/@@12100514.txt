' ' The Fury ' ' is the ninth studio album , and seventh under his own name , by musician Gary Numan , released in 1985 . It saw him continuing to explore the sampling-heavy industrial sound he had developed for the previous album ' ' Berserker ' ' in 1984 . The album was his second released under his self-owned Numa Records label . # Overview # Although Numan 's previous album ' ' Berserker ' ' had failed to make a notable commercial impact , Numan decided to continue with a similar sound for his next record . For the second time in his career he decided to team up with other people to produce his album , recruiting The Wave Team ( Mike Smith , Ian Herron ) as his co-producers . Colin Thurston assisted on the production of one track . ' ' The Fury ' ' , as the album was to be called , continued with the highly sampled , metallic , industrial sound heard on ' ' Berserker ' ' but added layers of electronic funk that he had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1982 ) and ' ' Warriors ' ' ( 1983 ) . The style would become a crucial part of his music as the 1980s progressed . As on ' ' Berserker ' ' , the rhythm section is dominated by aggressive electronic percussion and usage of samples , but the fretless bass that had been an important element on the previous album disappeared almost completely , with only three tracks on the new album featuring a bass . The rhythm elements were balanced with the usage of a PPG Wave synthesiser , saxophonist Dick Morrissey ( who had appeared on ' ' Warriors ' ' ) again provided the more melodic elements , while guitars were virtually non-existent . Tessa Niles and Tracey Ackerman contributed female backing vocals , similar to those already heard on ' ' Berserker ' ' , which would be another continuing theme in Numan 's work until the early 1990s . Of the album , Numan later recalled : The usage of sampling on the album is especially prominent on the album 's anthemic opening track ( and second single ) , Call Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1982 science fiction movie ' ' Blade Runner ' ' . This marked the beginning of Numan 's fascination with the movie that would also resurface on his next three studio albums , ' ' Strange Charm ' ' in 1986 , ' ' Metal Rhythm ' ' in 1988 , and ' ' Outland ' ' in 1990 . The original album artwork was very much at odds with the music , featuring an oddly Bryan Ferry-like Numan dressed in a white suit with a red bow-tie , posing in a tilted photograph against a white-dominant background , with the album name written on a typeface reminding the viewer of 1950s futurism . Numan later admitted that the cover was completely inappropriate , probably did the album a great disservice and made him look like the man who lost it all at Monte Carlo . Your Fascination , Call Out the Dogs , and Miracles were released as singles in rapid-fire succession in August , September and November 1985 , charting at 46 , 49 , and 49 respectively . This was quite a poor turn-around compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only My Dying Machine had charted lower at 66 ) . Numan blamed the singles ' poor chart placements on the total lack of radio play they had received . In November 1986 a version of I Still Remember was released as a charity single , with all proceeds going to the RSPCA . Numan wrote and sung new lyrics for this version , changing the personal anguish theme of the original for a story of a dog mistreated by its owners and eventually dying at the end of the song . Despite the lack of successful singles , ' ' The Fury ' ' reached number 24 in the UK albums chart , higher than both ' ' Berserker ' ' and the ' ' White Noise ' ' ( 1985 ) live album released earlier the same year . ' ' The Fury ' ' remains the highest-charting album ever released by Numa Records , and was the last of Numan 's albums to reach the UK top 30 until October 2013 with the release of Splinter reaching #20 in the UK Album charts . Numan supported ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour in September and October 1985 . No live albums or videos have been released officially from the tour . # Different releases # The album was originally released in the UK on both LP , CD and cassette . A second cassette version was also available containing extended mixes of all nine tracks ; these extended mixes were released on CD in 1996 . In 1998 the album was issued on CD for the first time in the United States by Cleopatra Records . This release added five bonus tracks , including three alternate versions of songs on the album , and a cover photograph different from the UK release . The following year , the album was reissued on CD in the UK by Eagle Records . This issue also featured five bonus tracks , but dropped the alternate versions in favour of three additional out-takes . This reissue also used a cover artwork similar but not identical to the original UK cover , with Numan 's red bow-tie re-coloured white , amongst other changes . # Track listing # All songs written by Gary Numan , except This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
