Julia Thornton is a professional harpist , who to date has released two albums : Harpistry ( 2003 ) and Eye of the Storm ( 2004 ) . # Musical life and career # Julia Thornton began to play the harp aged 11 . Having wanted to do so since the age of three , her parents initially managed to stave off her persistence , allowing her piano lessons at the age of 9 . Eighteen months later , having taken well to the piano , she was allowed to have her first harp lesson . Beginning on an Irish instrument called the clarsach ( an instrument that is n't as big as a concert harp and does n't have the pedal mechanism ) , she was taught by a local teacher initially who had to return to her native Czechoslovakia after a year . After this she was taught by Daphne Boden ( who eventually became Thornton 's professor at the Royal Academy of Music ) . Within the year , Boden asked Thornton 's parents if they would buy her a concert harp - a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a Japanese instrument called Ahomaya . Thornton extended her studies by attending the Junior Department of the Royal College of Music on Saturdays , where she began also to learn percussion . At this time she also became a member of the National Youth Orchestra . Having won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music , she studied there for 5 years ( 1990 1995 ) , winning many prizes for her harp-playing ( including the Julia Leney and Renata Schefelstein harp awards , and both the harp prizes at the Royal Overseas League competition ) . She was also awarded the Mathias Prize for the best performance of his Sante Fe Suite at the International Harp Competition in Cardiff . After finishing at the R.A.M. , Thornton 's work consisted of a mixture of teaching , orchestral and solo work . She performed with a wide variety of orchestras , opera and ballet companies , and gave recitals including performances at the Cambridge , Beaumaris and Cheltenham music festivals . She also joined the panel of Yehudi Menuhin 's Live Music Now ! , which enables young musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in schools , day-care centres , homes for the elderly , homes for those suffering from Alzheimers or dementia , prisons and young offenders ' institutes . Julia 's main breakthrough came at a yoga demo in 1999 , where she was playing the harp , and was thus spotted by one of the attendees - Clare Davies , wife to Bryan Ferry 's producer , Rhett Davies . Following an audition , she began working with Bryan Ferry , performing on the harp and percussion instruments on his As Time Goes By tour , which comprised a collection of 1930s standards such as the title track . In 2001 she was asked to join the Roxy Music reunion tour - a tour that would involve 50 days of percussion-playing only , and despite her love for the harp , Thornton took this opportunity . The tour involved visits to Australia and Japan , and playing in some of the world 's biggest stadia such as Wembley . The seeds of Harpistry were sown during her involvement with a mediaeval instrumental group , Arcana Mundi , a concept dreamt up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure enough , she signed a deal with EMI in 2002 , and between trips abroad with Bryan Ferry , she sourced the material for her first album , with help from Leon . She recorded her first album , Harpistry , in the Netherlands in 2003 , before going to Brazil on another Bryan Ferry tour . On Sept 1 2005 , www.PlaybillArts.com reported that Harpistry charted no. 13 on the Billboard Classical chart . She released her second album , Eye of the Storm , on her own label , Crossways Records , due to frustrations with EMI .

According to her webpage , Julia has plans to go into the studio and record her own music and record with members of Lunar Dunes , a band that she has sat in with .
