They play in the Southern Football League . # First Team # Manager : Assistant Manager : Coach : Secretary : Daniel Bennett # Youth Team # Manager : Secretary : # Staff # Chairman : Patrick Bennett Director of Football : # History # The club 's forerunners were a team called Runnymede Rovers who were established in 1877 and played in red and white colours the present club have now adopted as their own . Rovers were reformed as Egham FC in 1905 and were founder members of the Surrey Senior League , claiming the inaugural Championship . The club had an unsuccessful six-year spell in the Spartan League between 192733 before returning to the Surrey Senior League , in which they played until disbanding upon the outbreak of World War II . Unlike many clubs , Egham FC did not reform at the end of the War and it was not until a public meeting at the town 's Literary Institute on December 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local council offered the use of part of a recreation ground for the new club to play on and this remains the club 's home , although it is now an impressive ground for a club of Egham Town 's stature . The former park has been developed into the Runnymede Stadium as it is known today . The ground has cover on all sides . Having played in the Parthenon League in 196465 season , Town returned to the Surrey Senior League in 1965 , and then moved back into the Spartan League , claiming the title in 197172 . They were then elected into the Athenian League and captured the Second Division Championship at the first attempt in 197475 and finishing as First Division runners-up the following season . When the Isthmian League expanded in 1977 , the Sarnies were duly elected but after finishing 6th in their first season success always eluded them . They have reached the fourth round of the FA Vase once in their history the 198485 season . They narrowly missed promotion from the final season of the regionalised Division Two in 199091 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the following season as Two and Three . Egham finished third in Division Two South with a tally of 87 points and 100 goals both would have been good enough in almost any other season to secure one of the two promotion spots . In that season , they also had the best ever run in the FA Cup , reaching the 4th Qualifying Round before losing at Telford United . The 199192 season saw the Sarnies reach the Finals of the Surrey Senior Cup and Loctite Trophy but lose both . The club then went into a decline that culminated in relegation from Division Two of the Isthmian League in 199798 . The Club was promoted to Division One South of the Isthmian League as part of a re-organisation of non-league football but were switched to the Southern League in 2004 , which proved disastrous . In the 200506 season they played in the Isthmian League Division Two but as a result of the restructuring of non-league football they now play in the Combined Counties League Premier Division . Season 200607 began promisingly , but more managerial upheaval and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th with 58 points . The following season the same number of points were accumulated , but a couple of heavy losses in the early part of the season led to a season long battle against relegation . They did however , enjoy a league cup run to the semi-finals , where they lost to Bedfont Green . Despite pre-season optimism , the club continued to struggle during 20082009 with the loss through injury of the previous season 's top marksman , Jamie Thornby , hitting them hard , and crushing defeats to local rivals Chertsey Town and Molesey led to another change in management , this time with former player Steve Baker taking the reins . He steadied the ship , and the campaign ended with four straight wins and a final league position of 13th place with 56 points . Baker 's first full season saw the club finish 4th after a long unbeaten run , which success gave the club byes for the first two rounds of the FA Vase . However , even with some fine wins and , at one stage early in season 201011 returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that change was needed , with a greater emphasis on youth development . The club was in seventh place when Steve Baker was replaced by John Hamsher . John Pomroy , who had joined club at the start of the season from neighbours and rivals Chertsey Town , notched up 26 goals . The 2012-13 season proved to be Egham Town 's season , coming out as Combined Counties Premier Division champions after a neck and neck title chase with Islanders , Guernsey FC . But the season got of to a shakey start , after the management team of John Hamsher and Wayne Noad left the club to take charge of Chipstead in the Ryman League South - taking a handful of players with them . Lee Passmore , a player with a strong playing background , ( who had suffered a major leg break in the first game of the season ) , was offered the job of taking over the reigns and wasted no time in installing Jack Mckinley and Neerav Patel into the management team . Their first game in charge was at home to Badshot Lea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - coming out 3-2 winners in an enthralling match with Enrico Rossini scoring a late goal to seal the win . In the 2010-11 Season , Egham introduced a new youth team ( U18 's ) , which was managed and run by In the first season , the U18 's finished a respected fourth in the Southern Youth League . The following season was a huge success as the U18 's won the League and League cup double , beating South Park 3-2 in the Final which was played at Sutton United Football Club .
