Telebit was a US-based modem manufacturer , known for their TrailBlazer series of high-speed modems . One of the first modems to routinely exceed 9600 bit/s speeds , the TrailBlazer used a proprietary modulation scheme that proved highly resilient to interference , earning the product an almost legendary reputation for reliability despite mediocre ( or worse ) line quality . They were particularly common in Unix installations in the 1980s and 1990s. # Startup # Telebit was founded by Paul Baran , one of the inventors of the packet switching networking concept . Baran had recently started a networking company known as Packet Technologies on Bubb Road in Cupertino , California , which was working on systems for interactive television . While working there , he hit on the idea for a new way to implement high-speed modems , and started Telebit across the street . Packet Technologies was a major beta customer for Telebit in late 1985 . Packet Technologies later failed , and several of their employees were folded into Telebit , while most of the others formed StrataCom , makers of the first Asynchronous Transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TrailBlazer # negotiating and communicating In contrast to then-existing ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector ( ITU-T ) V-series protocols , such as the common 2400 bit/s V.22bis , the TrailBlazers ' proprietary ' ' Packetized Ensemble Protocol ' ' ( PEP ) modulation employed a large number ( initially up to 512 ) of closely spaced carrier frequencies , each modulated at 6 baud , encoding 0 , 2 , 4 or 6 bits per interval . Under favorable conditions , the devices could reach data rates of 6 baud x 6 bits-per-baud x 512 carriers = 18432 bits per second . If a particular carrier was distorted , attenuated or interfered with , it could be turned off , allowing the data rate to degrade gracefully with decreasing line quality . Most modems of the era were set up with both channels with equal speed ( full duplex ) , or , in the case where data was primarily sent in one direction , with a single high speed channel ( half duplex ) . The TrailBlazer instead allowed any one of its 512 channels to be assigned to transfer data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The modem was designed to use most of the bandwidth in a single direction , with a relatively low speed reverse channel . The modems at the two ends of the connection would negotiate line turnarounds , reversing the directions of the high-speed and low-speed channels , based on the amount of data queued for transmission in each modem . While this adaptive duplex scheme was able to send large files quickly , for users accustomed to having the distant computer echo characters , the delay associated with having the DSPs take turns using the bandwidth tended make interactive typing difficult , as there could be as much as a second and a half delay for a single character echo . This also caused problems for file transfer protocols , e.g. , UUCP ' g ' or Kermit , where a small packet of data was sent by one computer , followed by a wait for acknowledgment from the receiver ( send and wait ) . The TrailBlazer addressed this problem through a technique known as protocol spoofing . When the local computer sent a packet to the modem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACK  message , generated locally . This fooled the computer into thinking the packet had already reached the far end , prompting it to send another packet . The error correction normally being applied in the protocol was instead handled using a proprietary replacement protocol operating on top of the MNP error-correcting protocols to talk to the remote modem . In general , spoofing worked well with any protocol that used small packets , and thus generated lots of  ACK  messages ; initially UUCP , and support for XModem and Kermit followed . Support for these features did not come easily ; the TrailBlazer Plus , for instance , used a Motorola 68000 to drive its electronics . This meant that the TrailBlazers were generally very expensive . However , its spoofing ability made the TrailBlazer modems extremely popular in the Unix world , as it could dramatically improve UUCP throughput , even at low connection speeds on very noisy lines . Improvements of over 7 times faster than a 2400 bit/s modem were not uncommon . Sites that required long-distance telephone calls to exchange UUCP mail could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly quickly . The Trailblazers also introduced an extensive set of commands for setting up its various options . While most of the simple commands were based on the Hayes command set , like dialing a number or hanging up a phone , their proprietary capabilities were supported by proprietary commands and syntax . Most of these took the form of  register=  ' ' value ' ' pairs , leading to extremely long and almost undecipherable setup strings . In 1988 Telebit added the T1000 , essentially a TrailBlazer limited to a lower-speed 9600 bit/s version of PEP , remaining compatible at that speed with existing TrailBlazers . The T2000 added support for synchronous communications , typically used between mainframe computers . The original TrailBlazer , T1000 and T2000 were backwards-compatible with the 2400 bit/s V.22bis standard , allowing them to connect with what was then the most common modem speed when talking to other brands of modems. # NetBlazer # Another Telebit product was the first on-demand Internet dialup router , the NetBlazer . The product was developed by a team led by Mike Ballard , formerly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and president in 1992 . The original NetBlazer was a standard PC with a serial card connected to user supplied external modems by serial cables . Later smaller versions , the PN and STi , were offered which consisted of a small-form-factor PC combined with custom software and one of a variety of modems or other connection systems ( ISDN , etc. ) combined into a large modem-like box . Administrators connected to it via Ethernet , which was also used for maintenance commands and setup . In its first release the NetBlazer software supported TCP/IP using SLIP , but a later upgrade added Point-to-Point Protocol ( PPP ) and support for IPX and AppleTalk . The protocol stack was a commercially licensed version of KA9Q . Later versions of the hardware switched from the Intel 80386 to a low-cost microcontroller version of the Motorola 68030 , the MC68EN360. # Increasing speeds # Telebit had their initial public offering in April 1990 , which raised about $20.2 million . It traded on NASDAQ with the symbol TBIT . The first multi-company standard for 9600 bit/s dialup modems was V.32 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Rockwell introduced modules , and eventually entire chipsets , that brought the prices down . Telebit first offered V.32 support in the T2500 , which used the Trailblazer/T2000 hardware with the addition of the Rockwell V.32 modem module . A version without PEP support was offered as the T1500 . The later T1600 had basically the same feature set as the T1500 , but used Telebit 's own V.32 implementation rather than the Rockwell module , resulting in reduced production cost and better performance . Both the T1500 and T1600 had list prices over $1000 ; at the time a 1st tier product from Hayes or U.S. Robotics ( USR ) generally cost about $700 . The V.32bis standard , increasing the bit rate to 14,400 bit/s , was introduced in 1991 . In this case Rockwell quickly released a V.32bis chipset , appearing on the market so rapidly that Rockwell-based systems generally pre-dated implementations from other companies . Rockwell also aggressively priced the V.32bis product line , allowing modems based on them to sell at price points around $300 , the point formerly held by 2400 bit/s models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities . All of the 1st tier companies had serious difficulties adapting to a market that was now filled with low-cost modems with similar or better performance and features than their own high-end models . Telebit started slipping in terms of relative performance , while still trying to sell their products at their traditional high price points . They finally introduced the T3000 with V.32bis but without PEP , though a PEP upgrade was planned . Instead , Telebit re-released it in early 1994 as the $1,099 WorldBlazer model ; essentially a T3000 with the new 23,000 bit/s TurboPEP mode . An upgrade from the T3000 to WorldBlazer was sold , consisting of two firmware ROMs and a PAL chip . There were some design studies of a possible full-duplex PEP using echo cancellation ( as is used in V.32 ) , and this technology was proposed to the CCITT ( now known as the ITU-T ) for possible adoption as the V.fast modem standard . However , more conventional modem technology was chosen and standardized as V.34 . Telebit deemed full-duplex PEP to require more engineering effort than was justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced this feature . # The Octocom merger and the FastBlazer V.34 modem # The CCITT moved quickly to improve on V.32bis , and by 1993 it was clear that the ratification process for their new 28,800 bit/s V.34 standard was going to be finalized in 1994 . Companies lined up to start production of new V.34 designs , some going so far to introduce models based on interim standards , such as V.FC . Telebit 's modem engineering team developed a plan for a V.34 modem , but the executive staff believed that it was important to get a product to market more quickly . To that end , they began looking for other modem companies to acquire , and in January 1993 announce that Telebit would acquire Octocom Systems , a small privately held modem company in Massachusetts . Octocom had a V.34 modem in development which was expected to be ready for shipment quickly . Almost all modem engineering activities at Telebit 's California offices ceased , though NetBlazer engineering continued to be based in California until the end of 1995 . The Telebit FastBlazer 8840 V.34 modem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first introduced it did not include V.34 support , with management stating that they could n't do so because the standard was not yet ratified . Although this was true ( for one month anyway , it was ratified in June ) , the FastBlazer did not ship with an interim standard either ; even AT&amp;T 's largely ignored 19,200 bit/s V.32terbo would only be available as a post-release upgrade in July , there were no plans to support the widespread V.FC at all , and no date was set for full V.34 support other than two or three months . Making matters worse , the FastBlazer did n't include fax support . While Telebit stated that an upgrade to add this would be available , they also stated they would be charging for it . Nor would the FastBlazer support PEP , which , although by then a minor consideration for most potential buyers , was still a differentiator for Telebit 's existing installed base . For sites with a Telebit modem on at least one end of a link , a PEP-capable upgrade might be worthwhile . Without PEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V.34 modem . All this for an introductory price of $1,399 , when V.32bis faxmodems were available for $200 or less , and industrial-quality V.34 designs were soon available for under $500 . It took seven months before Telebit introduced V.34 support in January 1995 , also releasing the $399 TeleBlazer low-end model at the same time . By this point even long-time supporters were publicly pooh-poohing the company on the UseNet , the medium that originally drove the widespread adoption of the TrailBlazer. # Next phase # Late in 1993 Telebit completed their merger with Octocom , the idea being to use Octocom 's Chelmsford , Massachusetts manufacturing capability , downsizing the existing Sunnyvale office to become a NetBlazer development site . The Sunnyvale facility was closed to reduce costs . Higher than expected operating costs resulted in stagnation with the development of new products . By March 1996 the company had exhausted its line of credit , reducing cash by $3.2 million on revenues of $12.7 million in the quarter . In July 1996 Telebit was acquired by Cisco Systems for $200 million , primarily for their channelized T1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Telebit management convinced Cisco to spin off the company including all existing product families as well as a paid-up license for the use of MICA in future products developed by the spinoff to one of the existing management team ( James D. Norrod ) to become Telebit Incorporated and based in Chelmsford . In August 1997 Telebit merged with ITK Telekommunikation , based in Dortmund Germany . The combined company was purchased a year later in July 1998 by Digi International , makers of the DigiBoard multi-port serial card for PCs . Digi was primarily interested in Telebit 's ISDN product family and eventually other product inventory was liquidated in March 1999. # Legacy # While the Trailblazers have generally been displaced by modems implementing the higher-rate V.34/V.90 series standards , and although they have been out of production since the mid-1990s , many TrailBlazers continue to be in operation to this date , and repair services are still available . Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ( OFDM ) , which is used in both the ITU Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ( ADSL ) and IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In particular , these protocols reuse PEP 's concept of carrying a single data link over many lower rate frequency-division multiplexing sub-carriers . In 1995 , a Silicon Valley engineer sent a Worldblazer to an NGO in Somalia , which promptly put it to work connecting that remote country to the Internet , at first by UUCP , then by other means . # Models #
