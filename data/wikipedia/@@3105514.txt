The Crossness Pumping Station is a former sewage pumping station designed by the Metropolitan Board of Works 's Chief Engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette and architect Charles Henry Driver at the eastern end of the Southern Outfall Sewer in the London Borough of Bexley . Constructed between 1859 and 1865 , as part of Bazalgette 's redevelopment of the London sewerage system , it features spectacular ornamental cast ironwork , that Nikolaus Pevsner described as a masterpiece of engineering &amp;ndash ; a Victorian cathedral of ironwork . It is adjacent to Erith Marshes , a grazing marsh , the northern part of which is designated as Crossness Nature Reserve . This provides a valuable habitat for creatures ranging from moths to small amphibians and water voles. # Opening # The Southern Outfall Works , as the complex was originally called , was officially opened on 4 April 1865 , by Edward , Prince of Wales , attended by Prince Alfred , the Duke of Cambridge , Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar , the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Archbishop of York and the Lord Mayor of London , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bazalgette , the Royal party toured the works and reservoirs , and the Prince then turned the wheel which started the engines and , as the Illustrated London News observed , a sensible vibration was felt throughout the building , showing that the enormous beams , lifting-rods and flywheels were in operation . # Operation # At Crossness , the incoming liquid was raised some 30 to 40 feet by the application of four large steam driven pumps . The engines were of enormous size and power . They were built by James Watt &amp; Co. to Joseph Bazalgette 's designs and specification , and were named Victoria , Prince Consort , Albert Edward and Alexandra . At 11 revolutions per minute , 6 tons of sewage per stroke per engine were pumped up into a 27e6impgal m3 reservoir , and was released into the Thames during the ebbing tide . The steam required to power these engines was raised by 12 Cornish boilers with single straight-through flues situated in the Boiler House to the south of the Engine House , and which consumed 5,000 tons of Welsh coal annually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river seawards , and in 1882 , a Royal Commission recommended that the solid matter in the sewage should be separated out , and that only the liquid portion remaining should be allowed , as a temporary measure , to pass into the river . In 1891 , sedimentation tanks were added to the works , and the sludge was carried by steam boats and dumped further out into the estuary , at sea . By 1897 , additional pumping capacity was needed , and four extra pumps operated by triple-expansion steam engines were installed in an extension , designed to fit in with Bazalgette 's main engine house , to the north of the older building . Later , in 1899 , a further increase in London 's population necessitated an increase in the efficiency of the original Watt engines , and considerable alteration to their design was carried out by Goodfellow and Co of Hyde , Manchester , for London County Council . They were converted from simple to compound engines with the original single cylinders were augmented by high and intermediate pressure cylinders . The additional steam required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient Lancashire boilers with double flues and in 1901 the improved engines were fully working . In 1913 , the triple expansion steam engines were replaced by diesel engines , which are still to be seen in the triple expansion engine house , and by 1956 , the Watt-Goodfellow engines had been decommissioned , ( Prince Consort having been temporarily put back in steam in 1953 to assist with draining the flooding of the eastern Royal Arsenal and Abbey Wood ) and were left , with the rest of the ironwork , to rust and to vandals . # Restoration # The pumping station became a Grade I listed building in 1970 and will remain on the Heritage at Risk Register until the restoration is completed . The Crossness Engines Trust , a registered charity , was formed in 1987 to oversee the restoration project which is due to be completed in 2013 . When the pumping station was decommissioned in the 1950s it was not considered economic to dismantle the engines as the cost of doing so far exceeded any scrap value . The more valuable metal items ( made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipework and even the handrails from the stairs were removed . The remaining building and engines were left to suffer considerable vandalism and decay . As Prince Consort was to be the last steam engine to run , in 1953 , it is this engine on which the restoration activity has been concentrated . After some fifteen years of effort the engine is now working again and is run on the open days organised by the Trust . When the buildings were abandoned , the pumps and culverts and all the below ground level areas below the Beam Engine House were filled with sand to reduce the risks from methane . This has meant that some 100 tons of this sand has had to be excavated from around and underneath the pumps before there was any hope of moving the beam and flywheel . Further , there was a considerable ingress of rain water which has resulted in serious rusting of the engine parts . The station contains the four original pumping engines , which are thought to be the largest remaining rotative beam engines in the world , with 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are original , they are not in their original 1864 configuration as all four engines were converted from single cylinder to the current triple expansion operation in 1901 and 1902 . Prince Consort was returned to steam in 2003 and now runs on Trust Open Days . The other engines are not in working order , although work has begun on the restoration of Victoria . The original boilers did not survive and Prince Consort is now steamed by a small ' off the shelf ' boiler . This boiler has nowhere near the steam capacity of the originals , but this is not a problem as the engine no longer operates under load . # Museum # Having received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and other benefactors , work is currently progressing at the site to build an access road , protect the buildings and to develop a museum focusing on the Great Stink of 1858 and the role of Crossness in improving London 's sewerage system . # In popular culture # The pumping station has been used as a filming location for the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' The Crimson Petal and the White ' ' . The building was also used as the setting for the final mission of the video game The Getaway : Black Monday .
