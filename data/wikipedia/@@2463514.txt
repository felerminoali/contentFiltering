' ' Pipes of Peace ' ' is the fifth solo studio album by Paul McCartney , released in 1983 . As the follow-up to the popular ' ' Tug of War ' ' , ' ' Pipes of Peace ' ' was nearly as successful and the source of more big hits for McCartney although critics were much cooler on the album than they were on its predecessor . # Background and structure # Upon its release , many were quick to notice that ' ' Pipes of Peace ' ' mirrored its predecessor in many ways . It was produced by George Martin , it featured two collaborations with the same artist ( this time with Michael Jackson ; the ' ' Tug of War ' ' collaborations being with Stevie Wonder ) , and continued McCartney 's alliance in the studio with Ringo Starr , former 10cc guitarist Eric Stewart and his last session work with Wings guitarist Denny Laine . The reason for all of this is that many of the songs released on ' ' Pipes of Peace ' ' were recorded during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , with Pipes of Peace , The Other Me , So Bad , Tug of Peace and Through Our Love being recorded afterward in September/October 1982 . By November , McCartney would start shooting his self-written motion picture ' ' Give My Regards to Broad Street ' ' , co-starring wife Linda , Ringo Starr and Tracey Ullman , which would take up most of his time throughout 1983 . Due to the filming commitments ( and to allow a reasonable lapse of time between his new album and ' ' Tug of War ' ' ) , ' ' Pipes of Peace ' ' was delayed until October for release . With momentum building for his film projectand the accompanying soundtrack albumMcCartney would spend much of his energies finishing and preparing for ' ' Give My Regards to Broad Street ' ' until its release in the autumn of 1984 . In 1983 Pipes of Peace made its debut on CD on Columbia Records .
