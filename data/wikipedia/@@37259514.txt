The kingdom of Yamhad was being threatened by the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I who had surrounded Yamhad through his alliance with Charchemish and Urshu to the north , Qatna to the south , and conquering Mari to the east . Yarim-Lim ascended the throne after his father was killed in 1780 during his campaigns against Shamshi-Adad .
