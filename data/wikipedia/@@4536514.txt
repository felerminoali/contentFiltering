According to Asger Aaboe , the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia , and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descendants in direct line from the work of the late Babylonian astronomers.Aaboe , Asger .

B. F. Walker . Cambridge University Press , ( 1991 ) Our knowledge of Sumerian astronomy is indirect , via the earliest Babylonian star catalogues dating from about 1200 BCE . The fact that many star names appear in Sumerian suggests a continuity reaching into the Early Bronze Age . The history of astronomy in Mesopotamia , and the world , begins with the Sumerians who developed the earliest writing systemknown as cuneiformaround 35003200 BC . The Sumerians developed a form of astronomy that had an important influence on the sophisticated astronomy of the Babylonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mesopotamian mythology and religion , began with the Sumerians . They also used a sexagesimal ( base 60 ) place-value number system , which simplified the task of recording very great and very small numbers . The modern practice of dividing a circle into 360 degrees , of 60 minutes each hour , began with the Sumerians . During the 8th and 7th centuries BCE , Babylonian astronomers developed a new empirical approach to astronomy . They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems . This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science , and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution . This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy . Classical Greek and Latin sources frequently use the term Chaldeans for the astronomers of Mesopotamia , who were , in reality , priest-scribes specializing in astrology and other forms of divination . Only fragments of Babylonian astronomy have survived , consisting largely of contemporary clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Babylonian planetary theory is in a fragmentary state . Nevertheless , the surviving fragments show that , according to the historian A. Aaboe , Babylonian astronomy was the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena and that all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy , in the Hellenistic world , in India , in Islam , and in the Westif not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciencesdepend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways . # Old Babylonian astronomy # Old Babylonian astronomy refers to the astronomy that was practiced during and after the First Babylonian Dynasty ( ca. 1830 BC ) and before the Neo-Babylonian Empire ( ca. 626 BC ) . The Babylonians were the first to recognize that astronomical phenomena are periodic and apply mathematics to their predictions . Tablets dating back to the Old Babylonian period document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year . Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of cuneiform tablets known as the ' ' Enma Anu Enlil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Tablet 63 of the ' ' Enma Anu Enlil ' ' , the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa , which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years . It is the earliest evidence that planetary phenomena were recognized as periodic . The MUL.APIN contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting heliacal risings and settings of the planets , and lengths of daylight as measured by a water clock , gnomon , shadows , and intercalations . The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in ' strings ' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right-ascensions or time intervals , and also employs the stars of the zenith , which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences . There are dozens of cuneiform Mesopotamian texts with real observations of eclipses , mainly from Babylonia. # Planetary theory # The Babylonians were the first civilization known to possess a functional theory of the planets . The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa , a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as the second millennium BC . This is largely due to the current fragmentary state of Babylonian planetary theory , and also due to Babylonian astronomy being independent from cosmology at the time . Nevertheless , traces of cosmology can be found in Babylonian literature and mythology . In Babylonian cosmology , the Earth and the heavens were depicted as a spatial whole , even one of round shape with references to the circumference of heaven and earth and the totality of heaven and earth . Their worldview was not exactly geocentric either . The idea of geocentrism , where the center of the Earth is the exact center of the universe , did not yet exist in Babylonian cosmology , but was established later by the Greek philosopher Aristotle 's ' ' On the Heavens ' ' . In contrast , Babylonian cosmology suggested that the cosmos revolved around circularly with the heavens and the earth being equal and joined as a whole . The Babylonians and their predecessors , the Sumerians , also believed in a plurality of heavens and earths . This idea dates back to Sumerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there being seven heavens and seven earths , linked possibly chronologically to the creation by seven generations of Gods . # Neo-Babylonian astronomy # Neo-Babylonian astronomy refers to the astronomy developed by Chaldean astronomers during the Neo-Babylonian , Achaemenid , Seleucid , and Parthian periods of Mesopotamian history . A significant increase in the quality and frequency of Babylonian observations appeared during the reign of Nabonassar ( 747734 BC ) , who founded the Neo-Babylonian Empire . The systematic records of ominous phenomena in Babylonian astronomical diaries that began at this time allowed for the discovery of a repeating 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses , for example . The Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy later used Nabonassar 's reign to fix the beginning of an era , since he felt that the earliest usable observations began at this time . The last stages in the development of Babylonian astronomy took place during the time of the Seleucid Empire ( 32360 BC ) . In the 3rd century BC , astronomers began to use goal-year texts to predict the motions of the planets . These texts compiled records of past observations to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , or shortly afterwards , astronomers created mathematical models that allowed them to predict these phenomena directly , without consulting past records . # Arithmetical predictions # Though there is a lack of surviving material on Babylonian planetary theory , it appears most of the Chaldean astronomers were concerned mainly with ephemerides and not with theory . Most of the predictive Babylonian planetary models that have survived were usually strictly empirical and arithmetical , and usually did not involve geometry , cosmology , or speculative philosophy like that of the later Hellenistic models , though the Babylonian astronomers were concerned with the philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe . In contrast to Greek astronomy which was dependent upon cosmology , Babylonian astronomy was independent from cosmology . Whereas Greek astronomers expressed prejudice in favor of circles or spheres rotating with uniform motion , such a preference did not exist for Babylonian astronomers , for whom uniform circular motion was never a requirement for planetary orbits . There is no evidence that the celestial bodies moved in uniform circular motion , or along celestial spheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers during this period include the discovery of eclipse cycles and saros cycles , and many accurate astronomical observations . For example , they observed that the Sun 's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform , though they were unaware of why this was ; it is today known that this is due to the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit around the Sun , with the Earth moving swifter when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion . Chaldean astronomers known to have followed this model include Naburimannu ( fl. 6th3rd century BC ) , Kidinnu ( d. 330 BC ) , Berossus ( 3rd century BCE ) , and Sudines ( fl. 240 BCE ) . They are known to have had a significant influence on the Greek astronomer Hipparchus and the Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy , as well as other Hellenistic astronomers . # Heliocentric astronomy # The only surviving planetary model from among the Chaldean astronomers is that of Seleucus of Seleucia ( b. 190 BC ) , who supported Aristarchus of Samos ' heliocentric model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aetius , Strabo , and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi . Strabo lists Seleucus as one of the four most influential Chaldean/Babylonian astronomers , alongside Kidenas ( Kidinnu ) , Naburianos ( Naburimannu ) , and Sudines . Their works were originally written in the Akkadian language and later translated into Greek . Seleucus , however , was unique among them in that he was the only one known to have supported the heliocentric theory of planetary motion proposed by Aristarchus , where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun . According to Plutarch , Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system through reasoning , though it is not known what arguments he used . According to Lucio Russo , his arguments were probably related to the phenomenon of tides . Seleucus correctly theorized that tides were caused by the Moon , although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the Earth 's atmosphere . He noted that the tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world . According to Strabo ( 1.1.9 ) , Seleucus was the first to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon , and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon 's position relative to the Sun . According to Bartel Leendert van der Waerden , Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model . He may have used trigonometric methods that were available in his time , as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus . None of his original writings or Greek translations have survived , though a fragment of his work has survived only in Arabic translation , which was later referred to by the Persian philosopher Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi ( 865-925 ) . # Babylonian influence on Hellenistic astronomy # Many of the works of ancient Greek and Hellenistic writers ( including mathematicians , astronomers , and geographers ) have been preserved up to the present time , or some aspects of their work and thought are still known through later references . However , achievements in these fields by earlier ancient Near Eastern civilizations , notably those in Babylonia , were forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeological sites in the 19th century , many cuneiform writings on clay tablets have been found , some of them related to astronomy . Most known astronomical tablets have been described by Abraham Sachs and later published by Otto Neugebauer in the ' ' Astronomical Cuneiform Texts ' ' ( ' ' ACT ' ' ) . Since the rediscovery of the Babylonian civilization , it has become apparent that Hellenistic astronomy was strongly influenced by the Chaldeans . The best documented borrowings are those of Hipparchus ( 2nd century BCE ) and Claudius Ptolemy ( 2nd century CE ) . # Early influence # Many scholars agree that the Metonic cycle is likely to have been learned by the Greeks from Babylonian scribes . Meton of Athens , a Greek astronomer of the 5th century BCE , developed a lunisolar calendar based on the fact that 19 solar years is about equal to 235 lunar months , a period relation already known to the Babylonians . In the 4th century , Eudoxus of Cnidus wrote a book on the fixed stars . His descriptions of many constellations , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylonian originals . The following century Aristarchus of Samos used an eclipse cycle of Babylonian origin called the Saros cycle to determine the year length . However , all these examples of early influence must be inferred and the chain of transmission is not known . # Influence on Hipparchus and Ptolemy # In 1900 , Franz Xaver Kugler demonstrated that Ptolemy had stated in his ' ' Almagest ' ' IV.2 that Hipparchus improved the values for the Moon 's periods known to him from even more ancient astronomers by comparing eclipse observations made earlier by the Chaldeans , and by himself . However Kugler found that the periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian ephemerides , specifically the collection of texts nowadays called System B ( sometimes attributed to Kidinnu ) . Apparently Hipparchus only confirmed the validity of the periods he learned from the Chaldeans by his newer observations . Later Greek knowledge of this specific Babylonian theory is confirmed by 2nd-century papyrus , which contains 32 lines of a single column of calculations for the Moon using this same System B , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on clay tablets . It is clear that Hipparchus ( and Ptolemy after him ) had an essentially complete list of eclipse observations covering many centuries . Most likely these had been compiled from the diary tablets : these are clay tablets recording all relevant observations that the Chaldeans routinely made . Preserved examples date from 652 BC to AD 130 , but probably the records went back as far as the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar : Ptolemy starts his chronology with the first day in the Egyptian calendar of the first year of Nabonassar ; i.e. , 26 February 747 BC . This raw material by itself must have been tough to use , and no doubt the Chaldeans themselves compiled extracts of e.g. , all observed eclipses ( some tablets with a list of all eclipses in a period of time covering a saros have been found ) . This allowed them to recognise periodic recurrences of events . Among others they used in System B ( cf. ' ' Almagest ' ' IV.2 ) : *223 ( synodic ) months = 239 returns in anomaly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month ) . This is now known as the saros period which is very useful for predicting eclipses. *251 ( synodic ) months = 269 returns in anomaly *5458 ( synodic ) months = 5923 returns in latitude *1 synodic month = 29 ; 31:50:08:20 days ( sexagesimal ; 29.53059413 .. days in decimals = 29 days 12 hours 44 min 3 s ) The Babylonians expressed all periods in synodic months , probably because they used a lunisolar calendar . Various relations with yearly phenomena led to different values for the length of the year . Similarly various relations between the periods of the planets were known . The relations that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus in ' ' Almagest ' ' IX.3 had all already been used in predictions found on Babylonian clay tablets . Other traces of Babylonian practice in Hipparchus ' work are *first Greek known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes . *first consistent use of the sexagesimal number system . *the use of the unit ' ' pechus ' ' ( cubit ) of about 2 or 2. *use of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Means of transmission # All this knowledge was transferred to the Greeks probably shortly after the conquest by Alexander the Great ( 331 BC ) . According to the late classical philosopher Simplicius ( early 6th century ) , Alexander ordered the translation of the historical astronomical records under supervision of his chronicler Callisthenes of Olynthus , who sent it to his uncle Aristotle . It is worth mentioning here that although Simplicius is a very late source , his account may be reliable . He spent some time in exile at the Sassanid ( Persian ) court , and may have accessed sources otherwise lost in the West . It is striking that he mentions the title ' ' tresis ' ' ( Greek : guard ) which is an odd name for a historical work , but is in fact an adequate translation of the Babylonian title ' ' massartu ' ' meaning guarding but also observing . Anyway , Aristotle 's pupil Callippus of Cyzicus introduced his 76-year cycle , which improved upon the 19-year Metonic cycle , about that time . He had the first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 June 330 BC ( Julian proleptic date ) , but later he seems to have counted lunar months from the first month after Alexander 's decisive battle at Gaugamela in fall 331 BC . So Callippus may have obtained his data from Babylonian sources and his calendar may have been anticipated by Kidinnu . Also it is known that the Babylonian priest known as Berossus wrote around 281 BC a book in Greek on the ( rather mythological ) history of Babylonia , the ' ' Babyloniaca ' ' , for the new ruler Antiochus I ; it is said that later he founded a school of astrology on the Greek island of Kos . Another candidate for teaching the Greeks about Babylonian astronomy/astrology was Sudines who was at the court of Attalus I Soter late in the 3rd century BC . In any case , the translation of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the cuneiform script , the language , and the procedures , so it seems likely that it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans . Now , the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 29 or 30 days ; 12 or 13 months respectively ) . At the time they did not use a regular calendar ( such as based on the Metonic cycle like they did later ) , but started a new month based on observations of the New Moon . This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events . What Hipparchus may have done is transform these records to the Egyptian calendar , which uses a fixed year of always 365 days ( consisting of 12 months of 30 days and 5 extra days ) : this makes computing time intervals much easier . Ptolemy dated all observations in this calendar . He also writes that All that he ( =Hipparchus ) did was to make a compilation of the planetary observations arranged in a more useful way ( ' ' Almagest ' ' IX.2 ) . Pliny states ( ' ' Naturalis Historia ' ' II.IX(53) on eclipse predictions : After their time ( =Thales ) the courses of both stars ( =Sun and Moon ) for 600 years were prophesied by Hipparchus , .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of 600 years , but considering the enormous amount of computation required , this is very unlikely . Rather , Hipparchus would have made a list of all eclipses from Nabonasser 's time to his own .
