An intraplate earthquake is an earthquake that occurs in the interior of a tectonic plate , whereas an interplate earthquake is one that occurs at a plate boundary . Intraplate earthquakes are relatively rare . Interplate earthquakes , which occur at plate boundaries , are more common . Nonetheless , very large intraplate earthquakes can inflict heavy damage , particularly because such areas are not accustomed to earthquakes and buildings are usually not seismically retrofitted . Examples of damaging intraplate earthquakes are the devastating Gujarat earthquake in 2001 , the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes , the 1811-1812 earthquakes in New Madrid , Missouri , and the 1886 earthquake in Charleston , South Carolina . # Fault zones within tectonic plates # The surface of the Earth is made up of seven primary and eight secondary tectonic plates , plus dozens of tertiary microplates . The large plates move very slowly , owing to convection currents within the mantle below the crust . Because they do not all move in the same direction , plates often directly collide or move laterally along each other , a tectonic environment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments ; most occur on faults near plate margins . By definition , intraplate earthquakes do not occur near plate boundaries , but along faults in the normally stable interior of plates . These earthquakes often occur at the location of ancient failed rifts , because such old structures may present a weakness in the crust where it can easily slip to accommodate regional tectonic strain . Compared to earthquakes near plate boundaries , intraplate earthquakes are not well understood , and the hazards associated with them may be difficult to quantify . # Historic examples # Historic examples of intraplate earthquakes include those in Mineral , Virginia in 2011 ( estimated magnitude 5.8 ) , New Madrid in 1811 and 1812 ( estimated magnitude as high as 8.1 ) , the Boston ( Cape Ann ) earthquake of 1755 ( estimated magnitude 6.0 to 6.3 ) , earthquakes felt in New York City in 1737 and 1884 ( both quakes estimated at about 5.5 magnitude ) , and the Charleston earthquake in South Carolina in 1886 ( estimated magnitude 6.5 to 7.3 ) . The Charleston quake was particularly surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost no history of even minor earthquakes . In 2001 , a large intraplate earthquake devastated the region of Gujarat , India . The earthquake occurred far from any plate boundaries , which meant the region above the epicenter was unprepared for earthquakes . In particular , the Kutch district suffered tremendous damage , where the death toll was over 12,000. # Causes # Many cities live with the seismic risk of a rare , large intraplate earthquake . The cause of these earthquakes is often uncertain . In many cases , the causative fault is deeply buried , and sometimes can not even be found . Under these circumstances it is difficult to calculate the exact seismic hazard for a given city , especially if there was only one earthquake in historical times . Some progress is being made in understanding the fault mechanics driving these earthquakes . # Prediction # Scientists continue to search for the causes of these earthquakes , and especially for some indication of how often they recur . The best success has come with detailed micro-seismic monitoring , involving dense arrays of seismometers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causative fault can be located with great accuracy , and in most cases these line up in patterns consistent with faulting . Cryoseisms can sometimes be mistaken for intraplate earthquakes .
