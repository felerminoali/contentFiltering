birthplace = deathplace = London , England Sir Charles Spencer , 3rd Earl of Sunderland KG PC ( 23 April 1675 &amp;ndash ; 19 April 1722 ) , known as Lord Spencer from 1688 to 1702 , was an English statesman from the Spencer family . He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland ( 17141717 ) , Lord Privy Seal ( 17151716 ) , Lord President of the Council ( 17171719 ) and First Lord of the Treasury ( 17181721 ) . # Early life # He was the second son of Robert Spencer , 2nd Earl of Sunderland and Anne Digby , daughter of George Digby , 2nd Earl of Bristol . On the death of his elder brother Robert in Paris in September 1688 , he became heir to the peerage . Called by John Evelyn a youth of extraordinary hopes , he completed his education at Utrecht , and in 1695 entered the House of Commons as member for Tiverton . In the same year , he married Arabella , daughter of Henry Cavendish , 2nd Duke of Newcastle ; she died in 1698 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill , Duchess of Marlborough . This was an important alliance for Sunderland and for his descendants ; through it he was introduced to political life and later the dukedom of Marlborough came to the Spencers . In 1698 he plunged his family into scandal when his brother-in-law Donogh MacCarthy , 4th Earl of Clancarty , who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London for his support for James II and later escaped , was reconciled with his long-estranged wife , Charles ' sister Elizabeth . Charles , alerted by his servants , had Clancarty arrested . The result was a public uproar which gravely embarrassed his parents . William III treated the matter as a trifle , wondering why everyone teased him about that little spark Clancarty , and gave the couple permission to settle in Altona , Hamburg . His father 's biographer comments that the affair did not show Charles in a good light either as man or brother . # Career # Having succeeded to the peerage in 1702 , Sunderland was one of the commissioners for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was sent to Vienna as envoy extraordinary . Although he was tinged with republican ideas and had made himself obnoxious to Queen Anne by opposing the grant to her husband , Prince George , through the influence of Marlborough he was foisted into the ministry as Secretary of State for the Southern Department , taking office in December 1706 . From 1708 to 1710 , he was one of the five Whigs collectively called the ' ' Junto ' ' , who dominated the government , but he had many enemies , the Queen still disliked him , and in June 1710 , he was dismissed . Anne offered him a pension of 3000 a year , but this he refused , saying if he could not have the honour to serve his country he would not plunder it . When Marlborough protested about the dismissal , the Queen inquired sarcastically whether the Peace of Europe must depend on it ? She added that Sunderland was universally unpopular , which , though a prejudiced view , was probably true enough . Sunderland continued to take part in public life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanover about the steps to be taken in view of the approaching death of the queen . He made the acquaintance of George I in 1706 , but when the elector became king , Sunderland only secured the comparatively unimportant position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . In August 1715 , he joined the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal . After a visit to George I in Hanover , he secured in April 1717 the position of Secretary of State for the Northern Department . This he retained until March 1718 , when he became First Lord of the Treasury , holding also the post of Lord President of the Council . He was now effectively the prime minister . Sunderland was especially interested in the proposed peerage bill , a measure designed to limit the number of members of the House of Lords , but this was defeated owing partly to the opposition of Sir Robert Walpole . In 1719 he was one of the main subscribers in the Royal Academy of Music ( 1719 ) , a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage . The bursting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken some part in launching the scheme of 1720 , therefore public opinion was roused against him and it was only through the efforts of Walpole that he was acquitted by the House of Commons , when the matter was investigated . In April 1721 , he resigned his offices , but he retained his influence with George I until his death on 19 April 1722 . Sunderland inherited his father 's passion for intrigue , while his manners were repelling , but he stands high among his associates for disinterestedness and had an alert and discerning mind . From his early years he had a great love of books , and he spent his leisure and his wealth in forming the library at Althorp , which in 1703 was described as the finest in Europe . In 1749 part of it was removed to Blenheim Palace . Sunderland 's second wife died in April 1716 , after a career of considerable influence on the political life of her time . In 1717 , he married an Irish lady of fortune , Judith Tichborne ( d. 1749 ) , daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tichborne , 1st Baron Ferrard , ( Irish cr. 1715 ) and Elizabeth Gibbs . She later married Sir Robert Sutton . In 1722 Sunderland was implicated in what became known as the Atterbury Plot , to restore the House of Stuart , and his death was one of the factors which brought the Plot to light . The town of Sunderland , Massachusetts , was named in his honor in November of 1718 , just after he became Lord President of the Council . # Children # His first wife was Arabella Cavendish , daughter of Henry Cavendish , 2nd Duke of Newcastle .
