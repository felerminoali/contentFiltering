Scandinavian prehistory began when the Scandinavian peninsula , formerly entirely covered by thick ice , became free of ice at the end of the last ice age , c. 11,000 BC . At that time , a hunter gatherer people , the Ahrensburg culture , lived and hunted near the edge of the ice . It took until the 7th millennium BC for forest , wildlife and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers to fully colonise the newly available land . In southern Scandinavia , a Maglemosian culture ( c. 7500 BC &amp;ndash ; 6000 BC ) developed . The Maglemosian people lived in forest and wetland environments using fishing and hunting tools made from wood , bone and flint microliths . A characteristic of the culture are the sharply edged microliths of flintstone which were used for spear heads and arrowheads . Microliths finds are more sparse from c. 6000 BC and the period is said to transit into the Kongemose culture ( c. 6000 BC &amp;ndash ; c. 5200 BC ) . The finds from this period are characterised by long flintstone flakes which were used for making the characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades . The Erteblle culture ( c. 5300 BC 3950 BC ) is the name of a hunter-gatherer and fisher culture dating to the end of the Mesolithic period . It was followed by the Funnelbeaker culture ( 4000&amp;ndash ; 2700 BC ) a culture that originated in southern parts of Europe and slowly advanced up through today 's Uppland , Sweden . Tribes along the coasts of Svealand , Gtaland , land , north-eastern Denmark and southern Norway learnt new technologies that became the Pitted Ware culture ( 3200 BC 2300 BC ) . Around 2800 BC , metal was introduced in Scandinavia in the Corded Ware culture . In much of Scandinavia , a Battle Axe culture became prominent , known from some 3,000 graves . The period 2500 BC &amp;ndash ; 500 BC also left many visible remains to modern times , most notably the many thousands rock carvings ( petroglyphs ) in western Sweden at Tanumshede and in Norway at Alta . A more advanced culture came with the Nordic Bronze Age ( c. 1800 BC &amp;ndash ; 500 BC ) . It was followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century BC ) and the Roman Iron Age ( c. 1 &amp;ndash ; 400 AD ) . # Ice age # The pre-history of Sweden begins at the end of the Pleistocene epoch at the beginning of Holocene epoch , following the last ice age , the Weichselian glaciation . At the end of the ice age , large parts of south and middle Sweden was covered by water . Parts of Denmark , Scania and the Norwegian coast line were free from ice around 13000 BC , and around 10000 BC the rim of ice was around Dalsland , Vstergtland and stergtland . It was n't until 7000 BC that all of Svealand and the modern coastal regions of North-eastern Sweden were free of ice , although the land was by then deeply pressed underwater . In Scandinavia , the time following the ice age begins at circa 9500 BC and is called at first the Yoldia Stage , after the Yoldia Sea , then the Ancylus Stage , after the Ancylus Lake in turn named after ' ' Ancylus fluviatilis ' ' , a small fresh-water gastropod from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined and the Baltic Sea of the age was a fresh water lake called the Ancylus Lake . The Ancylus age is followed by formation of the Littorina Sea and the Litorina Stage ( named after the ' ' Littorina littorea ' ' mollusc ) at around 6200 BC . With the first human colonization of this new land ( the territory of modern Sweden was partly under water though , and with radically different coastlines ) during the Ancylus and Litorina ages begins the Nordic Stone Age . In recent years there have been archaeological finds in caves which strongly suggest human inhabitation of Scandinavia ' ' before ' ' the Weichsel glaciation , at least 50,000 years ago , presumably by Neanderthals. # Stone age # # Upper Paleolithic # As the ice receded reindeer grazed on the plains of Denmark and southernmost Sweden . This was the land of the Ahrensburg culture , whose members hunted over territories 100 000 km vast and lived in teepees on the tundra . On this land there was little forest but arctic white birch and rowan , but the taiga slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the reindeer and their hunters had moved for northern Scandinavia , forests had been established in the land . A culture called the Maglemosian culture lived in Denmark and southern Sweden , and north of them , in Norway and most of southern Sweden , the Fosna-Hensbacka culture , who lived mostly along the shores of the thriving forests . Utilizing fire , boats and stone tools enabled these Stone Age inhabitants to survive life in northern Europe . The northern hunter/gatherers followed the herds and the salmon runs , moving south during the winters , moving north again during the summers . These early peoples followed cultural traditions similar to those practised throughout other regions in the far north &amp;ndash ; areas including modern Finland , Russia , and across the Bering Strait into the northernmost strip of North America ( containing portions of today 's Alaska and Canada ) . During the 6th millennium BC , southern Scandinavia was clad in lush forests of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests . In these forests roamed animals such as aurochs , wisent , moose and red deer . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their predecessors , they also hunted seals and fished in the rich waters . North of the Kongemose people , lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden , called the Nstvet and Lihult cultures , descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures . These cultures still hunted , in the end of the 6th millennium BC when the Kongemose culture was replaced by the Erteblle culture in the south . # Neolithic # During the 5th millennium BC , the Erteblle culture took up pottery from the Linear Pottery culture in the south , whose members had long cultivated the land and kept animals . About 4000 BC South Scandinavia up to River Dallven in Sweden became part of the Funnelbeaker culture . The Pitted Ware culture then developed along Sweden 's east coast as a return to a hunting economy in the mid-4th millennium BC ( see the Alvastra pile-dwelling ) . It is not known what language these early Scandinavians spoke . It might have been similar to Basque , due to the distribution of the monuments by early megalith builders . Towards the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European , the Battle-Axe culture . This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord , and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages . This new culture was individualistic and patriarchal with the battle axe as a status symbol , and were cattle herders . However , soon a new invention would arrive , that would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia , the Bronze Age . # Bronze Age # During the Nordic Bronze Age , an advanced civilization manufacturing bronze weapons and bronze and gold jewellery appears in Denmark , parts of Sweden and parts of Norway . It has been assumed that this civilization was founded in amber trade , through contacts with Central European and Mediterranean cultures . The period 2300-500 BC was the most intensive petroglyph carving period , consisting of carvings of an agricultural nature and depicting warfare , ships , domesticated animals , etc . There has also been found petroglyphs with themes of sexual nature in Bohusln ; these are dated from 800-500 BC. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles on the Pre-Roman Iron Age , the Vendel Age , and the Roman Iron Age ' ' Tacitus ( about 98 AD ) described a nation called Suiones living on an island in Sea . These Suiones had ships that were peculiar because they had a prow in both ends ( the shape we recognise as Viking ships ) . This word ' ' Suiones ' ' is the same name as Anglo-Saxon ' ' Sweon ' ' whose country was called ' ' Sweoland ' ' ( Svealand ) . In ' ' Beowulf ' ' , this tribe is also called ' ' Sweoeod ' ' , from which the name ' ' Sweden ' ' is derived , and the country has the name Sweorice which is an old Anglo-Saxon form of the present Swedish name for Sweden . In the 6th century the Ostrogoth Jordanes mentioned a tribe named ' ' Suehans ' ' which is the same name as Tacitus ' ' ' Suiones ' ' . He also unwittingly described the same tribe by a different name , the ' ' Suetidi ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' Svj ' ' and the English ' ' Sweoeod ' ' . Several sources , such as ' ' Beowulf ' ' , ' ' Ynglingatal ' ' , ' ' Ynglinga saga ' ' , Saxo Grammaticus and ' ' Historia Norwegiae ' ' , mention a number of Swedish kings who lived in the 6th century , such as Eadgils , Ohthere and Onela , as well as a number of Geatish kings . Some of these kings were in all likelihood historic kings , although the sources sometimes give contradictory information , such as the death of Ottar . See Mythological kings of Sweden and Semi-legendary kings of Sweden . In those days the kings were warlords rather than kings as we understand that title today , and what was to become Sweden , Norway and Denmark in a ' ' modern ' ' sense , were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed constantly as the kings killed each other , and had the local assemblies accept them as kings . The politics of these early kingdoms are retold in ' ' Beowulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Norse sagas . One of the most powerful kings was the Swedish king who according to early sources only ruled what is today eastern Svealand . It is unknown when it happened and it probably happened several times , but when sources become more reliable the territories of the Swedish kings include Vstergtland and other parts of Gtaland . This stage is by some considered to be the beginning of Sweden , as we know it today . # See also # * Sami history * Prehistoric Sweden # Notes # # References # * Weibull , Curt , 1922 : ' ' Sveriges och Danmarks ldsta historia - en orientering ' ' , CWK Gleerups frlag , Lund .
