' ' Repetition ' ' ( ) is an 1843 book by Sren Kierkegaard and published under the pseudonym Constantin Constantius to mirror its titular theme . Constantin investigates whether repetition is possible , and the book includes his experiments and his relation to a nameless patient known only as the Young Man . The Young Man has fallen in love with a girl , proposed marriage , the proposal has been accepted , but now he has changed his mind . Constantin becomes the young man 's confidant . Coincidentally , the problem that the Young Man had is the same problem Kierkegaard had with Regine Olsen . He had proposed to her , she had accepted but he had changed his mind . Kierkegaard was accused of experimenting with the affections of his fiance . Charles K. Bellinger says ' ' Either/Or ' ' , ' ' Fear and Trembling ' ' and ' ' Repetition ' ' are works of fiction , novelistic in character ; they focus on the boundaries between different spheres of existence , such as the aesthetic and the ethical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of marriage ; they can be traced back to Kierkegaard 's relationship with Regine . There is much in this work that is autobiographical in nature . How much is left up to the reader . Kierkegaard explores the conscious choices this Young Man makes . Kierkegaard published ' ' Fear and Trembling ' ' , ' ' Three Upbuilding Discourses , 1843 ' ' and ' ' Repetition ' ' all on the same date , October 16 , 1843 . Abraham was the main character in ' ' Fear and Trembling ' ' and the ' ' Three Upbuilding Discourses ' ' were about love . ' ' Repetition ' ' presents a noticeable contrast between the other two books that is almost comical . He takes up the idea of repetition again in his 1844 work ' ' The Concept of Anxiety ' ' where he explores the concepts of sin and guilt more directly . # Structure # * ' ' Part One : Report by Constantin Constantius ' ' * ' ' Part Two : Repetition ' ' * ' ' Letters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ' ' Incidental Observations by Constantin Constantius ' ' * ' ' Letter from the Young Man , May 31 ' ' * ' ' Concluding Letter by Constantin Constanius , Copenhagen , August 1843 ' ' # Report by Constantin Constantius # Constantin believes that repetition and recollection are the same movement , except in opposite directions , for what is recollected has been , is repeated backward . An individual can remember some past event or emotional experience with intensity . That individual might try to repeat pleasure continuously and eternalize the pleasure in the temporal . This is what Constantin is trying to accomplish . He hopes that Repetition will become a new philosophical category . That it will trump Hegel and explain the relation between the Eleatics and Heraclitus . Mediation is a foreign word ; repetition is a good Danish word , according to him . He reports that he has met a melancholic young man and has decided to become his confidant .

During his conversation with the Young Man he comes to understand that he is in love but he talks about his love as though it were just a memory . He says the Young Man was deeply and fervently in love , that was clear , and yet a few days later he was able to recollect his love . He was essentially through with the entire relationship . His observations lead him to conclude that the young man really is n't in love , but that the girl ( he never calls her a woman ) is the occasion that awakened the poetic in him and made him a poet . He calls him the sorrowful knight of recollections only happy love . He has had his first love but that 's not anywhere near the experience of marriage . Kierkegaard says the following in ' ' Either/Or ' ' , The question , namely , is this : Can this love be actualized ? After having conceded everything up to this point , you perhaps will say : Well , it is just as difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I must respond : No , for in marriage there is a law of motion . Infatuation Constantin , the aesthetic schemer , tells the Young Man he should become a deceiver . He says , Be inconstant , nonsensical ; do one thing one day and another the next , but without Passion ( emotion ) He then goes to Berlin , because he had been there once before and he wants to see if he can repeat the same experience he had the first time . He goes to the same place he stayed on his first journey and finds that his landlord is now married . The landlord went on to prove the esthetic validity of marriage . He succeeded marvelously , just as well as he had the last time in proving the perfection of bachelorhood . . He tries to find repetition at the theater but it eludes him , he tries the coffee shop and finally says , I had discovered that there simply is no repetition and had verified it by having it repeated in every possible way . Stuart Dalton from The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a comedy and there is humor in much of the book . # Repetition # Constantin is still pursuing repetition . Now he 's seeking a sameness that has a far more anesthetic power than the most whimsical amusements when he gets a letter from the Young Man demanding that he keep unbroken silence about the whole affair he was speaking to him about and that he will not be seeing him anymore . He will correspond by mail only . Constantin says , This , then , is the thanks one gets for having trained oneself every day for years to have only an Job for help and will write his reports to Constantin . # Letters from the Young Man , August 15 May 31 # Two years after the death of his father , in the year 1840 , Sren Kierkegaard entered into an engagement of marriage with a young girl living in Copenhagen , whose name was Regine Olsen . However , he was very soon brought to the insight that no marriage was possible for him . He sought to break the engagement , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passionate outburst , in which she begged him not to leave her . Moved profoundly by the ardor of her love he sought to emancipate her and himself through the adoption of a very involved and curious method . Journal entries seem to indicate that Kierkegaard was wary of marriage as early as 1838 and that he had a definite reason for breaking off the engagement . Did he use the method endorsed by Constantin and become a deceiver ? The letters from the Young Man are either written in relation to Regine or they are a passionate cry for freedom . He wanted to find a truth to live and die for . The letters describe his inner struggle against the social norms of his time . Must he keep his pledge because the social order demands that he does it ? First he blames his psychologist but he still needs him . Existential philosophy calls this Ressentiment . Then he blames the girl . Then he appeals to Job . Then he questions his own existence and the concept of guilt . Existential philosophers call this an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing Philosophy of Sren **25;748970;TOOLONG His question is never what is love , but how do I know I 'm in love , how do you know you 're in love ? Too many people want to read about love in order to find out what love is . Kierkegaard says one must act , not just think about acting . His letter dated January 13 states he is now married and doing his best to be a husband . Contrasting Abraham in ' ' Fear and Trembling ' ' with the Young Man creates an excellent comedy when taken together . Abraham was n't anxious about the social order , he just followed God but the Young Man is overflowing with anxiety about what his friends will say about him , and he followed Job . Kierkegaard wrote in ' ' Fear and Trembling ' ' : It would be altogether desirable if esthetics would sometime attempt to begin where for so many years it has ended-in the illusion of magnanimity . As soon as it did this , it would be working hand in hand with the religious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esthetic from its battle with the ethical . Kierkegaard says , I perceived that he was a poet-if for no other reason I saw it in the fact that a situation that would have been taken easily in stride by a lesser mortal expanded into a world event for him . On December 6 , 1843 Kierkegaard published his ' ' Four Upbuilding Discourses ' ' , he explains this Young Man 's relation to Job in the following way , # In tempestuous times , when the foundation of existence is tottering , when the moment shivers in anxious expectancy of what may come , when every explanation falls silent at the spectacle of the wild tumult , when a persons innermost being groans in despair and in bitterness of soul cries to heaven , then Job still walks along , at the generations side and guarantees that there is a victory , guarantees that even if the single individual loses in the struggle , there is still a God who , just as he proportions every temptation humanly , even though the person did not withstand the temptation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear it yes , even more gloriously than any human expectancy . Only the defiant person could wish that Job did not exist , that he could completely divest his soul of the last love still present in the wail of despair , that he could whine about life , indeed curse life in such a way that there would not be even an echo of faith and trust and humility in his words , that in his defiance he could stifle the scream in order not to create the impression that there was anyone whom it provoked . Only a soft person could wish that Job did not exist , that he could instead leave off thinking , the sooner the better , could give up all movement in the most disgusting powerlessness , could blot himself out in the most wretched and miserable forgetfulness . ' ' Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses ' ' , Four Upbuilding Discourses , ' ' The Lord Gave , And The Lord Took Away ; Blessed Be The Name Of The Lord ' ' . ( Job 1:20-21 ) p. 111 # # Incidental Observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still thinks about the Young Man and the girl . As far as he 's concerned the Young Man is a poet . He says , A poet seems to be born to be a fool for the girls . If a girl made a fool of him to his face , he would think of it generous of her . The Young Man writes once more , on May 31 , to let Constantin know that the girl is married . Kierkegaard-The Young Man says , # I belong to the idea . When it beckons me , I will follow ; when it makes an appointment , I wait for it day and night ; no one calls me to dinner , no one expects me for supper . When the idea calls , I abandon everything , or , more correctly , I have nothing to abandon .

' ' Repetition ' ' p. 221 # Kierkegaard as well as the other two characters in the story belong to the idea of what a marriage is but not to the actuality of a real marriage . Kierkegaard calls the Young Man 's behaviour criminal . # Concluding Letter by Constantin Constanius , Copenhagen , August 1843 # Constantin addresses his readers He says , # Criticism # ' The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics ' ' , 1915 , had a short article about Sren Kierkegaard . They wrote , # In Gjentagelsen ( ' Repetition , ' October 1843 ) , Kierkegaard sketches an abortive transition to the religious sphere . ' Repetition ' is one of his characteristic ideas ; it signifies persistence in , and faithfulness to , a chosen course of life , and is thus opposed to the ( esthetic standpoint , with constancy only in change . But Kierkegaard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' resumption ' ( Gjentagelse , ' taking again ' ) implying that each higher stage of life carries with it the lower in a transfigured form . Gjentagelsen tells of a young man who seeks to pass from the ( esthetic to the religious sphere , but for want of a true penitence becomes merely a romanticist ; i.e. , he simply resumes his old self ; and his case is contrasted with that of Job , who humbled himself utterly before God , and at last regained all that he had lost , and morethe true ' repetition . # Lev Shestov was a philosopher who wondered how Russia had missed Kierkegaard . He understood ' ' Repetition ' ' in the following way . # Here is how Kierkegaard tells of this in his Repetition : The greatness of Job is therefore not that he said , ' The Lord hath given , the Lord hath taken away , blessed be the name of the Lord ' - what he indeed said at first and did not later repeat .. The greatness of Job lies in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him by any false expression .. Job demonstrates the compass of his world view through the firmness with which he knows how to eschew all crafty ethical evasions and cunning wiles . Everything that Kierkegaard says of Job can also be said of himself . And here is the closing passage in which Kierkegaard says , Job is blessed and received everything back again double . This is what people call a repetition .. Thus there is a repetition . When does it come ? When did it come for Job ? When all conceivable human certainty and probability was on the side of impossibility . And , according to Kierkegaard 's deep conviction , this repetition will obtain a very important role in the newer philosophy , for the new philosophy will teach that all of life is a repetition . ' ' Kierkegaard As A Religious Philosopher ' ' , by Lev Shestov , 1938 # Kierkegaard wrote , # What kind of power is it that wants to deprive me of my honor and my pride and do it in such a meaningless way ! Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I do nothing ? Or have I perhaps gone mad ? Then the best thing to do would be to lock me up , for people cravenly fear particularly the utterances of the insane and the dying . What does it mean : mad ? What must I do to enjoy civic esteem , to be regarded as sensible ? Why does no one answer ? I offer a reasonable reward to anyone who invents a new world ! I have set forth the alternatives . Is there anyone so clever that he knows more than two ? But if he does not know more , then it certainly is nonsense that I am mad , unfaithful , and a deceiver , while the girl is faithful and reasonable and esteemed by the people . ' ' Repetition ' ' p. 202 # He is always asking himself questions just as Johann Gottlieb Fichte had done in his 1800 book , ' ' The Destination of Man ' ' , also called ' ' The Vocation of Man ' ' where he wrote against the easy answer for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended for philosophers by profession , who will find in it nothing that may not be found in other writings of the same author . It is intended to be intelligible to all readers who are able really to understand a book at all . Those who have accustomed themselves merely to the repetition of certain sets of phrases in varied order , and who mistake this operation of memory for that of the understanding , will probably find it unintelligible . It ought to exercise on the reader an attractive and animating power , raising him from the sensuous world , to that which is above sense . The author at least has not performed his task without some of this happy inspiration . # Kierkegaard was influential in Martin Buber 's Philosophy and Martin Heidegger 's development of the new philosophical category Dasein . Rollo May wrote an excellent history of Existentialism from the psychological point of view . He said , Kierkegaard was very concerned about his relationship with God . C. Stephen Evans , says that # Kierkegaard regarded himself as a psychologist . Three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , ' ' Repetition ' ' , and ' ' The Sickness Unto Death ' ' , are designated as psychological by their subtitles , and he frequently called himself a psychologist in his journal . Imagine a nave Christian who knows nothing about psychology as a science-lets call him Kirk-engaged in conversation with a knowledgeable psychologist-Dr . John . Dr. John tells Kirk that psychology models itself after the natural sciences and attempts to gain a scientific understanding of human behavior and mental processes . Kirk asks Dr. John what psychologists think about God and Gods relationship to human beings . Dr. John replies that individual psychologists have different beliefs about God . He himself is a Christian , he tells Kirk , and of course , for him any ultimate understanding of human beings requires a theological perspective too . But , he hastens to add , his personal religious beliefs do not enter into psychology as a scientific discipline because science restricts itself to the natural realm , which can be studied by empirical methods . # # Dr. Johns answer leaves Kirk dissatisfied . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science may have to limit itself to the empirically observable , but he questions the value , or even the truthfulness , of the knowledge gained by such a science . After all , he thinks , isnt the most important thing about human beings their relationship to God ? Can anyone hope to understand them without understanding them in this light ? ' ' Sren Kierkegaard 's Christian Psychology : Insight for Counseling and Pastoral Care ' ' By C. Stephen Evans , ' ' Kierkegaard as a Psychologist ' ' , p. 25-26 # Clare Carlisle described the internal and external struggle that every existing individual has to go through . The struggle between philosophy and existence ( often a struggle internal to the individual , especially to the intellectual and perhaps academic individual who is this texts likely reader ) is essential to Kierkegaards dramatization of his conflict with Hegel . Throughout Kierkegaards pseudonymous authorship the abstract thinker , the pitiful professorial figure is criticized from the perspective of the existing individual . Challenging the Hegelian view that the Concept expresses the highest form of truth , texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the truth as knowledge and suggest instead that truth must be grasped in terms of subjectivity or inwardness . Both Constantin and the Young Man had the power to act as single individuals instead of trying to become world historically famous or worrying about the crowd but neither of them used the power . They both just pursued the idea . Kierkegaard says of them , Later , in ' ' The Concept of Anxiety ' ' , Kierkegaard discusses this power again in terms of the eternal . His idea of the eternal is comparable to Nietzsche 's idea of eternal return , only backwards . Niels Nymann Eriksen has written about Kierkegaard 's category of repetition . This book explores the Other and Becoming as well as Recollection and Repetition . # Primary sources # * ' ' Either/Or ' ' Part I Edited by Victor Eremita , February 20 , 1843 , translated by David F.
