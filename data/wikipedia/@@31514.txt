The Beyonder is a fictional character in . # Publication history # Created by Jim Shooter and Mike Zeck , the Beyonder first appeared in ' ' Secret Wars ' ' #1 ( May 1984 ) as an unseen force . He reappears in ' ' Secret Wars II ' ' #1 ( July 1985 ) , which was written by Jim Shooter and drawn by Al Milgrom. # Fictional character biography # # Secret Wars # The Beyonder is the sum total of a parallel reality called the Beyond-Realm or simply Beyond , hence the name Beyonder . This dimension is accidentally accessed by nebbishy lab technician Owen Reece . Part of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with near-infinite powers , which he wields as the villainous Molecule Man - potentially one of the most powerful villains in the Marvel Universe . The remaining energy of the pocket dimension apparently gains sentience and curiosity . Using its vast powers , the Beyonder creates a planet called Battleworld out of pieces of various planets ( one such piece being a suburb of Denver ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil that rages within humanity at large . Initially explaining the nature of the experiment to the involuntary participants , the entity identifies itself only as I am from beyond . The name Beyonder is quickly applied by Galactus and adopted by all others present . Galactus , sensing that the Beyonder could alleviate his perpetual hunger , immediately and aggressively charges into the Beyond-Realm through a dimensional rift , followed by Doctor Doom , who seeks power for his own purposes . Both are repelled , but the information gathered by Doom later enables him to use the body of the sound-based villain Klaw as a medium to steal the energies of Galactus ' Worldship and then the power of the Beyonder itself . With the Beyonder 's power , Doom constructs a high tower of golden stone as temporary quarters , and then states that he has given up his ambitions for conquest , instead simply being content with freeing his mother 's soul from Mephisto . The Beyonder 's consciousness then possesses Klaw 's damaged mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distracting him enough for the Beyonder to steal his power back . This story formed the basis of the first ' ' Secret Wars ' ' twelve-issue limited series . The series sold incredibly well , with circulation reaching up to 750,000 copies per issue , numbers reminiscent of the height of comic book sales during the Golden Age of Comic Books # Secret Wars II # Due to the high sales of the first series , a second ' ' Secret Wars ' ' series , the nine-issue ' ' Secret Wars II ' ' miniseries , was published . This series crossed over into almost every comic that Marvel was publishing at the time . Intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars , the Beyonder comes to Earth to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand . He creates a human body for himself ; originally , this body resembles Molecule Man . He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into Thundersword . Finally , the Beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of understanding of human biology and society , which leads to numerous difficult situations , some serious and some humorous . For instance , he needs to learn by example the difference between edible objects and non-edible ones , and needs to be toilet-trained by Spider-Man . When he learns about the monetary system from Luke Cage , the Hero for Hire , he transforms the Manhattan Heroes for Hire office building into gold as thanks for their assistance . He later comes under the influence of a criminal named Vinnie and becomes the head of a criminal cartel . The Beyonder then uses mind control to assume control over the entire Earth , only to relinquish control when he grows restless and frustrated with the lack of free will that the world now displays . Beyonder then transforms the elf Algrim into Kurse . The Beyonder became enamored with the beauty and power potential within singing superheroine Dazzler , resulting in a brief love affair . On a train to New York , the Beyonder meets the mutant Tabitha Smith ( also known as Boom Boom ) . Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Beyonder abandons her but returns and takes her to Xavier 's school . At the school , Tabitha is terrified when the teams of the X-Men and the New Mutants fight the Beyonder . The Beyonder takes her to a planet where the Celestials are located . There , threatening to destroy the universe , the Beyonder fights and seemingly defeats a number of Celestials . Fearful of a further battle taking place between the Beyonder and the Celestials , Tabitha demands to be returned to Earth . Back on Earth , Boom Boom alerts the Avengers about the Beyonder . Summoning the Beyonder , Boom Boom thereby leads him into an ambush by the Avengers , Fantastic Four , and other costumed champions . The Beyonder , who had regarded Boom Boom as his only friend , allows the Avengers to defeat him , but then leaves . Boom Boom leaves during the battle . The Beyonder then acts in an attempt to preserve life throughout the universe by seemingly eliminating and then resurrecting the manifestation of Death . Throughout the course of the series , the demon Mephisto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the favor of Death . Mephisto sends an army of supervillains called the Legion Accursed to attack the Beyonder , who is saved by the Thing . The Beyonder then fights the Puma , believing that the only purpose left in his life is to help the Puma find his by allowing Puma to become one with the universe and allow Puma to slay him- Puma having been convinced of the Beyonder 's nature as a malicious threat- , but a casual comment by Spider-Man about the Beyonder 's manipulations causes Puma to lose faith in himself at the crucial moment , and the Beyonder survives unscathed . The Beyonder then feels the futility of all his efforts and decides to destroy the entire multiverse . He starts by killing the New Mutants . He then battles Phoenix . The Beyonder reconsiders destroying the Multiverse , and resurrects the New Mutants . Realizing that he can never truly understand what its like to be mortal as long as he has his powers as a safety net , he constructs a machine to leech and contain his powers , turning him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes fearful of being without his power and takes his power back from the machine . Intrigued by this new experience , the Beyonder tries to create for himself a mortal human infant body that can retain his omnipotence , but will allow him to grow and learn at a normal rate . Although he is on the verge of succeeding , he is killed in the process by the Molecule Man . The Beyonder 's near-limitless power is returned to the now-empty Beyond-Realm , where it forms a Big Bang and creates a new universe . # Deadpool Team-Up # Long after the ' ' Secret Wars II ' ' crossover had ended , a Deadpool special featured the Secret Wars II continues in this issue corner tag that was used during that original storyline . In this issue , a younger , less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the Kingpin to kill the Beyonder . The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying to be continued in Secret Wars III . This storyline has yet to be followed up on . # Kosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprises the Beyonder and the energy that gives the Molecule Man his powers needs to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable , mature , nigh-omnipotent being to be born . The Beyonder then merges with the Molecule Man . This being , called Kosmos ( Marvel Comics ) At some unknown point , Kosmos goes mad and assumes a mortal form , now calling itself the Maker . After the now amnesiac Maker destroys a Shi'ar colony , the Imperial Guard manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the Kyln . The Maker 's madness takes control of several inmates , but is finally subdued by the nihilist Thanos and several of his allies among the prisoners . Thanos confronts the Maker , and , by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture , manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind . Thanos instructs the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead , or the Beyonder essence would go free again . Apparently , Thanos had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been explained , as Thanos was dead at the time of Secret Wars II . Thanos ' flashback showed Thanos as a youngster . # ' ' Beyond ! ' ' and Annihilation # The Beyonder returned in the series named after him , Beyond ! . This being was called The Beyonder in the second issue . This Beyonder is once again in command of the patchwork Battleworld , where it is revealed that he has been collecting various superhumans and pitting them in combat with one another . Eventually , the pool of heroes and villains featured in the mini-series discovers that this Beyonder is actually the Stranger , who has been conducting studies of super-humanity through re-creations of the original Secret War . In the Annihilation crossover , the former Herald of Galactus , the Fallen One , now under the control of Thanos , is sent to investigate the aftermath of the Kyln 's destruction by the Annihilation Wave and ascertain the Beyonder 's fate . The Fallen One soon finds the lifeless form of Kosmos in the rubble . # New Avengers : The Illuminati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' #3 , featuring a retcon of past events , Charles Xavier reveals that in the original Secret War , he had initially planned to use his powers to make everyone fall asleep and thus buy him and Reed Richards time to formulate an escape plan , but feared the Beyonder 's wrath . However , he immediately sensed a strange mental presence and attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder , revealing him as one of the Inhumans previously ruled over by fellow Illuminati member Black Bolt . Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder 's seemingly godlike abilities , which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a mutant , like Xavier and his own team of X-Men , and the exposure of his mutant genes to Terrigen Mists had created an unprecedented reaction , bestowing upon him more amazing power and knowledge than all other Inhumans of his time . This revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War , wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder 's activities . When encountered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Ceres ( dwarf planet ) The story itself is deliberately ambiguous ; Black Bolt , for example , does not remember the mutant Inhuman who vanished , making it possible the Beyonder arranged all this as a mind game , as he had when he lived as a human and a mutant , trying to find a purpose in his existence . # Powers and abilities # Although not native to this dimension , the Beyonder was one of the absolute strongest and most powerful beings ever to exist in the Marvel Universe . In the original Secret Wars storyline , he was the be-all and end-all of the Marvel universe that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings , and capable of destroying the entire multiverse or the conceptual entity Death itself . After his creator , Jim Shooter , left Marvel , writer-editor Tom DeFalco , displeased with Shooter 's tenure at Marvel , re-tooled the Beyonder and altered his origin . He was no longer omnipotent as many initially believed , being an incomplete Cosmic Cube , with less raw power and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed vast psionic abilities allowing him to control and manipulate matter and energy at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of cosmic entities . He was shown and described to repel Galactus like a bug , and even greatly exceeded the collected energy of the latter 's World-Ship . He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars , and later , by using his entire energies , created a universe out of his own being . When the Molecule Man extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos , their battle took place in more than three dimensions , and threatened vast portions of reality . In Kosmos ' ' Maker ' incarnation , she was stated as capable of reversing The Crunch itself , essentially collapsing the entire universe . The Beyonder could endow himself with a corporeal form of practically limitless strength and endurance . However , his scale of power has been claimed to be below that of the Living Tribunal and Eternity , the Celestials , or the Molecule Man ( when unfettered from his emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeline seen in ' ' Guardians of the Galaxy ' ' , the Beyonder provides Guardian Vance Astro with a black undergarment resembling a Symbiote . In the alternate Earth of ' ' Mutant X ( comics ) Mister Mxyzptlk parodied the Beyonder in his first appearance in the post-Crisis continuity by assuming a form and identity that was similar in clothing and appearance to the Beyonder . He called himself Ben Deroy , an anagram of the name Beyonder . When asked by Lois Lane where he came from , he answers by saying , Oh ... here and there . Yonder , let 's say . Yes . Yonder . In the ' ' Spider-Ham ' ' universe , The Bee-Yonder briefly appears to give Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform , stating that the familiar red-and-blue uniform was out of style . # In other media # The Beyonder makes an appearance in the ' ' Spider-Man ' ' cartoon voiced by Earl Boen . However , his appearance in the cartoon greatly differs from his normal comics , featuring the brief super hero costume the Beyonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a goatee as opposed to having a clean-shaven face with a disco outfit . He is also more of a neutral force than a villain . The Beyonder first appeared in the episode Arrival of Season 5 , the first chapter of that Secret Wars in the series . The Beyonder worked with Madame Web to prepare Spider-Man for the Secret Wars , supposedly to see whether good was more powerful than evil . He put Spider-Man and a small group of heroes selected by the web-slinger ( Fantastic Four , Captain America , Iron Man , Storm , and the Black Cat ) on a planet and pit them against a band of villains ( Doctor Octopus , Doctor Doom , Alistair Smythe , the Lizard , and the Red Skull ) . During this time , Doctor Doom stole the Beyonder 's powers in Doom ( the third and last chapter to the Secret Wars ) , but he was defeated , and it was implied that he had planned the whole ordeal out before it began . The Beyonder had all the heroes Spider-Man had summoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spider-Man , however , was needed for something bigger , so he was the only one whose memory was untouched . It was revealed that the evil Spider-Carnage had destroyed the entire multiverse with a giant bomb . However , when the destruction reached the Beyonder 's own reality , he used all of his powers to roll back time , but since his powers were unlimited only in his own universe he would be unable to permanently undo Spider-Carnage 's actions himself . Though it tested him to the extreme , he sent his servant , Madame Web , into the past to train Spider-Men from many different realities to find out which one would be worthy enough to lead the others against Spider-Carnage.
