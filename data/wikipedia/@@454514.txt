Marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar or honey and almond meal , sometimes augmented with almond oil or extract . It is often made into sweets ; common uses are marzipan-filled chocolate and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables . It is also rolled into thin sheets and glazed for icing cakes , primarily birthday and wedding cakes and Christmas cakes . This use is particularly common in England , on large fruitcakes . Marzipan ( or almond paste ) may also be used as a cake ingredient , as in stollen . In some countries , it is shaped into small figures of animals as a traditional treat for New Year 's Day . Marzipan is also used in Tortell , and in some versions of king cake eaten during the Carnival season . Traditional Swedish Princess Cake is typically covered with a layer of marzipan that has been tinted pale green . # Around the world # # Southern Europe # In Italy , particularly in Palermo , marzipan ( ' ' # New World # In Latin American cuisine , marzipan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe # In the Netherlands and Belgium , Marzipan figures are given as presents to children during Sinterklaas # Middle East # In the Middle East , marzipan ( known as ' ' lozina ' ' , which is derived from the word , the Arabic word for almonds ) is flavored with orange-flower water and shaped into roses and other delicate flowers before they are baked . Marzipan can also be made from oatmeal , farina , or semolina . In Iran , marzipan fruit is a traditional Passover treat , replacing cookies and cakes . # India and East Asia # In the Indian state of Goa , the Goan Catholic dish ' ' Mazpon ' ' replaces almonds with cashew nuts .

Other sources establish the origin of marzipan in China , from where the recipe moved on to the Middle East and then to Europe through Al-Andalus. # Northeast Mediterranean line # Although it is believed to have originated in Persia ( present-day Iran ) and to have been introduced to Europe through the Turks ( ' ' badem ezmesi ' ' in Turkish , and most notably produced in Edirne ) , there is some dispute between Hungary and Italy over its origin . Marzipan became a specialty of the Baltic Sea region of Germany . In particular , the city of Lbeck has a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture ( Lbecker Marzipan ( ' ' PGI ' ' ) . The city 's manufacturers like Niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain two thirds almonds by weight , which results in a product of highest quality . Historically , the city of Knigsberg in East Prussia was renowned for its distinctive marzipan production .

In Toledo ( 850-900 , though more probably 1150 during the reign of Alfonso VII ) this specialty was known as ' ' Postre Regio ' ' ( instead of ' ' Mazapn ' ' ) and there are also mentions in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights of an almond paste eaten during Ramadan and as an aphrodisiac . Mazapn is Toledo 's most famous dessert , often created for Christmas , and has PGI status . Almonds have to be at least 50% of the total weight , following the directives of ' ' Mazapn de Toledo ' ' regulator counseil . Another idea to support this line is the important tradition of another Spanish almond-based Christmas confectionery , the turron . Under EU law , marzipan must have # Variations # Persipan is a similar , yet less expensive product , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kernels . Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials , such as soy paste and almond essence . German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste , and French marzipan ( called ' massepain ' ) is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup . Some marzipan is flavored with rosewater . Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds . # Etymology # The German name has largely ousted the original English name ' ' marchpane ' ' with the same apparent derivation : March bread . ( The word ' ' marchpane ' ' occurs in Shakespeare 's ' ' Romeo and Juliet ' ' , Act 1 , Scene 5 , Line 9 . ) ' ' Marzapane ' ' is documented earlier in Italian than in any other language , and the sense bread for ' ' pan ' ' is Romance . The origin could be from the Latin term martius panis , which means ' ' bread of March ' ' . However , the ultimate etymology is unclear ; for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself from Greek Maza ) meaning pastry and Pan meaning bread , this can be particularly seen in the Provenal ' ' massapan ' ' , the Portuguese ' ' maapo ' ' ( where ' ' is an alternative form for the phoneme ' ss ' ) and old Spanish ' ' mazapn ' ' - the change from ' ss ' to ' z ' in Latin words was common in old Spanish and the ' r ' appeared later . Though , it could also be derived from martis pan , bread of March . Among the other possible etymologies set forth in the Oxford English Dictionary , one theory proposes that the word marzipan may be a corruption of Martaban , a Burmese city famous for its jars . The Real Academia Espaola suggests the idea of the Spanish word mazapn to be derived from the Hispanic Arabic pim , which is derived from the Greek .

From about the fifteenth century , when the coins were no longer in circulation , the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats . One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavored marzipan , named ( at least proximately ) after the box in which it was stored . However , if marzipan has its origin in Persia , it is not unlikely that the name may come from Marzban ( in Persian : , derived from the words Marz meaning border or boundary and the suffix -bn meaning guardian ) , a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the Sassanid Empire of Persia ( Iran ) between 3rd and 7th centuries CE . It is also a possibility that the origin of this dessert and the origin of the term come from different geographical places . # Production # To produce marzipan , raw almonds are cleaned by sieving , air elutriation , and other electronic or mechanical devices , then immersed in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . This loosens the almond 's skin , which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber-covered rotating cylinders . They are then cooled , after which they are coarsely chopped and ground , with up to 35% sugar , into almond flour . The almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled , after which sucrose ( table sugar ) and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added . It may then be molded into any shape .
