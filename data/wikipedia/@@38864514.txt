' ' Queloides ' ' is an ongoing cultural and curatorial project in Cuban art that seeks to highlight the persistence of racist stereotypes and ideas of racial difference in Cuban society and culture . Initiated in 1997 by artist Alexis Esquivel and by art critic Omar Pascual Castillo , who organized the exhibit ' ' Queloides I Parte ' ' , the project was later led by the late art critic Ariel Ribeaux Diago , who organized two important additional exhibits : ' ' Ni msicos ni deportistas ' ' ( Neither musicians nor athletes , 1997 ) , for which he wrote an award-winning essay , and ' ' Queloides ' ' ( 1999 ) . Queloides or keloids are raised scars that , many in Cuban believe , appear most frequently on the black skin . The title makes reference to the scars of racism , on the one hand , and to persistent popular beliefs that there are natural differences between whites and blacks . The main purpose of these exhibits was to initiate a public conversation around topics that had been taboo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 ) explained , I , as well as other colleagues had many questions and concerns about racial prejudice in Cuba , and I was convinced that through art we could express a valuable and instructive point of view .. In Queloides we paid attention to a non-romanticized vision of the daily existence of Cuban blacks The artists focused on the black person as a marginalized individual faced with economic disadvantages , traumas , and self reflection . Although these were groundbreaking cultural events that addressed issues of race and discrimination in Cuban society , they received very little coverage in the Cuban press and were quickly forgotten . In 2010 historian Alejandro de la Fuente and artist Elio Rodrguez Valds organized a new edition of the exhibit , titled ' ' ' ' . This exhibit opened at the Centro Wifredo Lam in Havana in April 2010 and was later presented at the in Pittsburgh , in New York City , and the Neil L. and Angelica Zander at the W.E.B . Du Bois Institute for African American Research at Harvard University . The Cuban media ignored the exhibit again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including favorable reviews in leading art journals such as ' ' ' ' , ' ' ' ' , ' ' ' ' and ' ' ' ' . The ' ' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ' ' called it a ground-breaking exhibition and listed it as number four in the year 's best art in the city in 2010 . In 2011 the important Cuban journal ' ' Artecubano ' ' published its own review of ' ' Queloides ' ' . Referring to ' ' Queloides : Race and Racism in Cuban Contemporary Art ' ' , literary scholar Ana Beln Martn-Sevillano ( 2011 ) has written : The impact of the ' ' Queloides ' ' sequence in the cultural field has made the term synonymous with the racial debate in Cuba . Designed with a comprehensive and inclusive view , one of the exhibit 's major achievements has been to include representative artwork that covers the diverse array of techniques and strategies used in contemporary Cuban art to address the complexity of the cultural and social processes of racialization . Furthermore , the 2010 ' ' Queloides ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not participated in the previous shows : Belkis Ayn , Maria Magdalena Campos Pons , and Marta Mara Prez Bravo . The work of these artist offers a compelling approach to issues of race and gender . # Sources # de la Fuente , Alejandro ( 2008 ) .
