His first attempt at dancing ends in humiliation . Erik and his two best friends , Bodicea and Atticus , follow Ramon to Adlie-Land and find that Adlie-Land has been ruled by a God-like penguin named Sven . Sven is actually a puffin in Adlie-Land who survived the loss of his native fishing grounds ( evidently ruined by a warming climate ) due to his miraculous ability to fly . Erik instantly becomes enamored with Sven , who takes a liking to him . Sven and Lovelace tell the others that they were saved by humans . The two eventually flee ( under Sven 's mistaken assumption that the humans were going to eat them ) and end up on Antarctica , where Sven performs his first miracle by revealing moss to the local penguins .

Mumble follows the chicks ' footprints to Adlie-Land and orders them to return to Emperor-Land , but they refuse . Sven sends Erik back to Emperor-Land with Mumble . Meanwhile , a couple of krill are in the midst of a swarm . Will is an adventurous and existentialist krill determined to discover what lies beyond the swarm . His friend , Bill , reluctantly follows him to ensure his safety . Once separated from the swarm , Will and Bill realize that krill are at the bottom of the food chain , created to be eaten . Inspired , Will ventures out to evolve and move up the food chain by eating a real creature instead of being eaten . Mumble tells Erik that he is unique to the world and that he will someday find his calling , but Erik is oblivious . While trying to cross a perilous ice bridge , the penguins encounter Bryan the Beach Master and his two young sons , who refuse to let the penguins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in a deep crevice below the ice . Mumble sets out to free Bryan by luring a leopard seal to chase him down . Seeking acceptance from Erik , Mumble is devastated to learn Erik attributed the feat of courage to Sven Think . Bryan returns to the Southern elephant seal beach . When the penguins return to Emperor-Land they discover that a large iceberg has trapped the Emperor Penguin population below large walls of ice . Bo ventures out to Adlie-Land to recruit the help of Ramon , the Amigos and the Adlie penguins to bring fish to the doomed Emperor penguins . Meanwhile , Mumble , Erik and Atticus deliver meager supplies of fish to the trapped penguins . Erik attempts to deliver a fish to Gloria by flying and nearly tossing himself over the edge of the iceberg .

When all hope seems lost , Bo returns with the entire Adlie-Land , led by Sven , to aid the trapped Emperor Penguins . Sven orchestrates a cooperative effort to feed the trapped Emperor Penguins through hunting and bringing back a flow of fish from the sea . Meanwhile , Will becomes increasingly agitated with Bill 's behavior and leaves him into the Adlie feeding swarm , to join fellow predators . In the process he is attached to a fish carried by Sven and down into the trapped Emperor-Land . The humans that saved Sven and Lovelace come to Antarctica again to help the penguins find a way out . However , a blizzard approaches and causes the humans to flee and not return .

Erik urges Sven to teach the penguins how to fly , but Sven reveals that he is not a penguin but a Puffin . He admits that after the loss of Svenland , he was lonely and grew to love the penguins who accepted him as a family . Mumble , after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg , begins to tap-dance on the ice and lead the Adlie penguins in a dance to force snow between the ice and weaken it . The plan works until several chunks break loose , sending Bo , Atticus , and a portion of the Adlies as well as several Chinstrap , Little Blue and Magellanic penguins into the doomed crevice . Erik and Lovelace tumble towards the edge , and Mumble grabs the thread from Lovelace 's vest . The thread snaps and Lovelace falls on Sven .

Meanwhile , Will , weary from the dangers he experienced as a predator on the surface , ventures back into the sea to find Bill , but not before experiencing the penguin 's dancing . He is suddenly forced down a crack in the ice and into the sea beneath Emperor-Land . Reuniting with Bill and his swarm , the krill enter the inaccessible ice below Emperor-Land . Mumble and Erik arrive at Elephant Seal Beach where Bryan is in the middle of a fight of dominance between another large male . Mumble pleads to the elephant seals to help free the Emperor Penguins . Bryan , initially hesitant to return a favor at such a pivotal time of the year , refuses . Discovering his singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan for his lack of kindness . The elephant seals travel en-masse to Emperor-Land . The penguins and the seals begin slamming the ice on the beat , joined by Will , Bill and their krill swarm below the ice .
