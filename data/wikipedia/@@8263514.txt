Durham House , or Durham Inn , was the historic London town house of the Bishop of Durham in the Strand . Its gardens descended to the River Thames . # History # # Origins # Bishop Thomas Hatfield built the opulent Durham House in about 1345 . It had a large chapel and a high-ceilinged great hall supported by marble pillars . On the Strand side its gatehouse led to a large courtyard . The hall and chapel faced the entrance , and private apartments overlooked the river . Accounts describe Durham House as a noble palace befitting a prince . King Henry IV , his son Henry , Prince of Wales ( later Henry V ) , and their retinues stayed once at the residence . # Tudor and Jacobean era # Durham House remained an episcopal palace until Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall relinquished it to King Henry VIII , who contracted to give the bishop in return Coldharbour and other residences but never honoured that promise . Henry granted Durham House to his daughter Princess Elizabeth ( later queen ) for life , or until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later confirmed the grant , and thereby deprived Tunstall of his palace . However , on her accession to the throne Queen Mary removed the house from the possession of Princess Elizabeth and restored it to Tunstall , together with his see , as it had become apparent Tunstall no longer had a London residence . Mary 's predecessor , Lady Jane Grey , the Nine Days Queen of England , was married at Durham House on May 21 or 25 , 1553 to Guilford Dudley . Upon her accession , Elizabeth seized possession of Durham House again , and deprived Tunstall of his see ; she kept possession of the residence until 1583 , when she granted it to Sir Walter Raleigh . Raleigh spent 2,000 on repairs and lived there until Elizabeth 's death . John Aubrey said that he well remembered the room which Raleigh used as his study ; it was in a little turret that looked over the Thames and had a view of Westminster , Whitehall Palace , and the Surrey hills .

In 1584 Sir Walter Raleigh had dispatched the first of a number of expeditions to Roanoke island to explore and eventually settle the new land of Virginia . Early encounters with the natives were friendly , and , despite the difficulties in communication , the explorers were able to persuade two of the savages , being lustie men , whose names were Wanchese and Manteo to accompany them on the return voyage to London , Once safely delivered to England , the two Indians quickly made a sensation at the royal court . Raleigh 's priority however was not publicity but rather intelligence about his new land of Virginia , and he restricted access to the exotic newcomers , assigning the brilliant scientist Thomas Harriot the job of deciphering and learning the Carolina Algonquian language , using a phonetic alphabet of his own invention in order to effect the translation . Upon Elizabeth 's death and Raleigh 's resultant loss of influence at court , Tobias Matthew , then bishop of Durham , reclaimed Durham House for the see and offered it for use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved the move . # Decline # Neither Matthew nor any of his successors resided at Durham House , and it became dilapidated as a result . The stables were demolished for construction of the New Exchange , a market which was occupied by milliners and seamstresses in shops along upper and lower tiers on each side of a central alley . In the 1630s it was the setting for the Durham House Group , including Richard Neile , William Laud and other high church Anglicans . The best portion of the house was tenanted by Thomas Coventry , 1st Baron Coventry Lord Keeper Coventry , who died there in 1640 . What remained of the house was subsequently obtained by Philip Herbert , 5th Earl of Pembroke . He rented it from the see for 200 per year and intended to build a fine house on the site , which was never realised . Instead , he constructed on the site Durham Street , which ran through the old remains down to the River Thames and the upper portion of which survives at its junction with the Strand .

The last portion of the ruins was cleared away early in the reign of King George III ( 1760-1820 ) , when the brothers Robert Adam and James Adam built the Adelphi thereby raising the whole level on lofty arches . # Notes # # Source # * # Bibliography # *Borer , Mary Cathcart .
