The Early 2012 Hong Kong protests were a series of protests by residents of Hong Kong against Chinese Peking University professor Kong Qingdong , who had made televised remarks suggesting that many Hong Kong people were disloyal to China and still harboured a colonial mentality . Kong was responding to the release of a survey finding that Hong Kong people feel increasingly separate from , and superior to , Mainland Chinese people . Anti-Mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong is growing because of the perception that Mainland Chinese mothers are flocking to Hong Kong to give birth . About 150 people gathered at the Chinese liaison office on January 22 in order to protest Kong 's remarks . And since Leung Chun-ying elected and inaugurated as Chief Executive of Hong Kong , protests of anti-government of Hong Kong SAR and central government increases ongoing . # Background # # Cultural identity # Since 1997 , University of Hong Kong professor Robert Chung ( ) had been regularly conducting surveys on how residents in Hong Kong view their own identity . In December 2011 , Chung 's poll showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only 34% thought of the same way of being Chinese first . This is the highest ratio of those who consider themselves primarily as Hong Kong residents since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 . After Chung published his results , two pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong , ' ' Wen Wei Po ' ' and ' ' Ta Kung Pao ' ' alleged that Chung was a political fraudster with evil intentions to incite people to deny they are Chinese . One pro-Beijing columnist asked whether Chung 's actions are subversive , and whether his scholarship is a slave of political bribery . Chung rejected the charges of bias and released a statement that the Cultural Revolution-style curses and defamations are not conducive to the building of Chinese national identity among Hong Kong people . Another professor targeted was Dixon Sing ( ) of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology . In December 2011 Pro-Beijing media said he was an anti-China Western trained vicious dog because he gave interviews to Falun Gong media . But his real issue may have been to support the 2010 Five Constituencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released to ask the university to fire him . The Communist party officials see both professors as a connection between pro-democracy movements and the way HK people see themselves . The Students ' union have since come out to protect professor Sing in a public statement about the One Country , Two Systems being violated . They believe that regardless of pro-establishment or pro-democratic views , the views need to be respected in order for academic freedom to exist . # Influx of birth tourism # On 1 January 2012 a protest was held by more than 1,500 pregnant women and mothers with strollers against the number of Mainland Chinese mothers giving birth in the city . In 2001 , the Court of Final Appeal ruled in ' ' Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen ' ' that Hong Kong-born children of Chinese citizens were entitled to the right of abode in Hong Kong even if their parents had entered the territory as tourists . This ruling sparked a sharp rise in the number of Mainland Chinese mothers coming to Hong Kong to give birth . Hong Kong hospitals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2011 nearly half of all babies born in Hong Kong ( 38,043 out of 80,131 ) were born to Mainland Chinese mothers aiming for their children to get the right of abode so they could obtain education in Hong Kong . Hong Kong in general has one of the world 's lowest birth rates . The hospital systems are stressed . Nurses in the region have accused the city 's government of being incompetent and said Hong Kong residents should be prioritised over non-locals . For 2012 the Hong Kong government reduced the quota for number of Mainland Chinese women allowed to give birth in public hospitals . The quota call was made after doctors themselves made a rare public call to pressure the government to put a stop on the number of babies allowed as resources were stretched too thin . The cap is now set at 3,400 for public and 31,000 for private hospitals . Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced a four point plan to hold back the wave of Mainland Chinese women . Heavy charges are imposed on non-locals who turn up at emergency stops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources for border checks . Local authorities will crack down on people who assist women enter the territories . More raids will be done on unlicensed pregnant women hotels . About HK$6.6 million of public hospitals ' bad debt in 2010-11 was from non-local mothers not paying their bills . # Property investment # Many Hong Kong citizens blame wealthy Mainland Chinese for driving property prices beyond the reach of local citizens . In 2011 Mainland Chinese purchased a third of all residential flats in Hong Kong , according to Nomura research . Home prices also rose as much as 70% since 2009. # Incident # # Eating while on MTR controversy # In January 2012 , Ken Wai , a Hong Kong passenger , asked a Mainland Chinese woman and her child to stop eating on an MTR subway in Mandarin Chinese on a train bound for Mong Kok East Station . Eating and drinking is not allowed on the MTR . While the kid stopped eating , the mother accused him of making trouble and laughed at his bad Mandarin Chinese . This infuriated Mr. Wai who started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop the train , and ask both parties to get off the train to solve disputes . On 18 January Mr. Wai conducted an interview with Xinhua News Agency on the issue and expressed his anger . # Kong Qingdong 's remarks # A harsh public comment on followed this incident by the controversial professor Kong Qingdong from Peking University who is known for his nationalist views and use of profanity . He responded publicly You Hongkongers are Chinese , right ? But as I know , many Hongkongers do n't think they are Chinese . They claim that we are Hongkongers , you are Chinese . They are bastards . Those kinds of people used to be running dogs for the British colonialists . And until now , you Hongkongers are still dogs . You are n't human . Kong then claimed that Hong Kong citizens had failed to accept their responsibility to speak the real Chinese language Mandarin Chinese because of the residues of colonialism . He then threatened If Hongkongers keep discriminating against mainlanders Mainland Chinese in that way , then we wo n't provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And asked Can Hongkongers still survive ? Go to seek help from your British daddy . After exposure by the media , however , Kong Qingdong claimed that he only made the remarks for the Hong Kong peoples benefit , and that he only called some people dogs . According to ' ' Ming Pao ' ' , Kong claimed that normal people , educated people should all understand what he meant , and that he thinks every place has some people who are dogs . Some Beijing people are dogs . If someone really says that all Hong Kong people are dogs , then I agree , that person should apologize . Since the only party claiming that Hong Kong people are dogs is ' ' Southern Daily ' ' . I demand that they apologize to both the Hong Kong people and me ! The online video network that published Kongs remarks later claimed that Kongs views do not represent the networks . # Protests # Many Hong Kong citizens were infuriated by his remarks , and Hong Kong 's ' ' Open ' ' magazine openly asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suggesting that the Communist Party of China has been supporting Kong Qingdong behind the scene . Petitions for expelling Kong from Peking University , which was previously called for when he rejected the ' ' Southern Weekly ' ' interview with an expression of profanity , was also renewed . On 22 January 2012 , about 150 protesters gathered at the Liaison Office to protest against Kong Qingdong 's statement . People brought their pet dogs and carried signs saying We are not dogs . Some protesters claimed that Hong Kongers dislike the Communist Party precisely because the Party had , in their views , deformed Chinese culture and tradition . # Reaction # # Kong Qingdong # Kong criticized the protest as an attempt to suppress ( his ) freedom of speech through government action . Chinese reaction to Kongs remarks had been divided ; while some criticized his insult on the Hong Kong people , others have expressed support for Kong . # Hong Kong electoral candidates # Both running candidates for the next Chief executives position , Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying have come out to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying professor Kong Qingdong needs to be responsible for his own statement and that Hong Kong citizens are not dogs . He emphasized this is how Hong Kong citizens deal with each other in a free society . Leung Chun-ying responded by saying that Kong 's statement did not actually reflect the views of Mainland Chinese . He added that this is part of the Hong Kong spirit to respect the law , and that professor Kong Qingdong should not be overreacting. # Other notable response # * The prominent Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei complained about Peking University 's tolerance of Kong Qingdong 's behavior , calling Peking University a nest of turtles . * Susan Tse , a Hong Kong opera actress and a fellow descendant of Confucius , criticized Kong Qingdong 's lack of tolerance and respect of the Hong Kong people . Tse further suggested that Kong should apologize to the Hong Kong people . * The Chinese scholar and television personality Yi Zhongtian criticized Kong 's remarks , calling Kong 's characterization of speakers of non-Mandarin Chinese dialects as bastards an affront to thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yi would rather be a bastard than agree with Kong . * The Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong also rebuked Kong 's remarks , suggesting that if the Hong Kong people are dogs , then Kong Qingdong is a blood relative of dogs . * An analysis was done by yzzk ( Asia magazine ) , who gave many examples of popular YouTube links showing Mainland Chinese misbehaving every day in Hong Kong causing anger . It also highlight many Chinese events such as fight for democracy during the 1989 protest , help with activists in need , help with territorial dispute ( Diaoyutai islands ) , disaster relief ( 2008 Sichuan earthquake ) and many more events that HK citizens participated in and were overlooked . * Jack So , former MTR chairman and CPPCC member who was born in Taiwan , said We are all the same , we are all Chinese with the same surnames . # Advertisement controversy # # Anti-Chinese advertisements # Members of the Hong Kong Golden Forum raised more than HK$100,000 to purchase a full-page advertisement in ' ' Apple Daily ' ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured a giant locust overlooking the city skyline of Hong Kong . Locusts stereotypically represent Mainland Chinese . The ad makes the statement Would you like to see Hong Kong spend HK$1 million every 18 minutes on the children of non-Hong Kongers ? Hong Kongers have had enough ! We demand the unlimited infiltration of Mainland Chinese couples into Hong Kong . The advertisement also employs the derogative term double illegitimacy ( ) , which refers to residents of Hong Kong with both parents of illegal status within the territory . Protesters also argued against Hong Kong Basic Law Article 24 , although Rita Fan have already said these newborns do not qualify for right of abode . Hong Kong protesters also launched anti-Mainland Chinese groups on Facebook that reached high popularity , prompting local media to refer to it as an Anti-Locusts campaign . At least one entry on Sina microblog has been reposted 97,000 times and received 30,000 comments according to the ' ' Global Times ' ' . The Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission expressed concern over the full-page advertisement ; Chairman Lam Woon-kwong said that vilifying remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rational debate . The Communist party has long been known for ignoring pro-Democracy groups and denying certain citizens Home Return Permits and other rights . # Mainland Chinese response # Mainland Chinese microblogs launched a retaliatory advertisement against the locust slur , claiming that if it was n't the mainland Chinese treating you like a son , you would have died long ago . We must not allow this son ( Hong Kong ) to ride on our shoulders anymore . Let 's temporarily cut off the son 's water , electricity and food ! # Copycat advertisement : Shanghai grassroot against other Mainland Chinese response # A similarly duplicate ad by shanghai grassroots reused the same picture posted from the HK golden forum , but the words were changed . This copycat ad claims 4 billion RMB is spent each year to subsidize non-locals in Shanghai . In Shanghainese dialect it declares Shanghainese have had enough . Because you have come for the gold rush , we have to receive 17,566,700 outsiders . # Additional controversy # # Democracy wall # Around 7 Feb , at the Democracy wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribing the words in Chinese characters : Anti-Locusts ( ) . The case have been under investigation . Some students believe this type of vandalism on the democracy wall is just a response to Mainland Chinese society not tolerating democracy . # Tension extends to university # The tension between HK and Mainland China has extended to universities where between 2010 to 2011 Mainland Chinese students were granted 2/3 of the scholarships . There were limited resources available to begin with , now these HK citizens have to compete with Mainland Chinese for education , scholarships and jobs post study . Chinese University of Hong Kong vice Chancellor Joseph Sung have recognized the uneasiness about the situation . The cultural differences also add to the tension where many students from HK and Mainland China ca n't live together in some campuses . # Tension extends to Singapore # A Mainland Chinese student Sun Xu ( ) from Jiangsu province under Chinese government scholarship at the National University of Singapore wrote a message in Singapore there are more dogs than humans on internet forums . Sun Xu faced disciplinary actions and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment is said to be influenced by Kong Qingdong . While the comment has raised many issues , some people have agreed . A comment followed by a Mr. Lin who said Singaporeans are Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor who bleed Chinese blood . There is no need to rename a Chinese into a Singaporean. # Conflict between Hong Kong and Chinese reporters # On 10 March 2012 , a press conference on the issue of Mainland Chinese mothers giving birth in Hong Kong was held by Guangdong governor Zhu Xiaodan . As the conference was about to end , RTHK reporter Chan Liu-ling asked for Hong Kong reporters to be given a chance to ask questions . Instead the host let reporter Lu Hong-chao from Hong Kong Commercial Daily ( owned by Shenzhen Press Group ) ask the last question . As Lu is a Mainland Chinese , some Hong Kong reporters were unhappy and said He is n't from Hong Kong . After the press conference , a fight broke out between Lu and TVB reporter Cheng Sze-ting . Lu who thought that Cheng made the comment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist pass from her chest . When Lu Hong-chao attempted to leave , Cheng Sze-ting , Chan Miu-ling and other Hong Kong reporters surrounded him and requested an apology . At the time other Mainland Chinese reporters joined the quarrel and questioned whether Cheng was discriminating against Mainland Chinese , despite the Mainland Chinese host of the press conference host picking on Mainland Chinese during the Q&amp;A session .
