So one day a guard of Hberlins regiment sat next up to the coachman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goods at the designated area . They were going on a mountainous road which had many turns , when all of a sudden Hberlin appeared out of nowhere and harshly questioned the guard why he was sitting on the coach instead of running alongside it . The flabbergasted soldier answered in all honesty , Because Colonel , Sir , I have noticed you too late ! , upon hearing this , Hberlin started to laugh heartily and let the soldier off the hook due to the guards honesty . # Further reading # *Soland , Rolf ( 1997 ) .
