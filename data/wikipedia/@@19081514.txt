Stigler 's law concerns the supposed tendency of eponymous expressions for scientific discoveries to honor people other than their respective originators . Examples include : # A # * AharonovBohm effect . Werner Ehrenberg and Raymond E. Siday first predicted the effect in 1949 , and similar effects were later rediscovered by Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm in 1959. * Alzheimer 's disease , though named after Alois Alzheimer , had been previously described by at least half a dozen others before Alzheimer 's 1906 report which is often ( wrongly ) regarded as the first description of the disorder . * America , named after Amerigo Vespucci ( the name was given by German cartographers Martin Waldseemller and Matthias Ringmann ) , although Vespucci was not the first European to find either North or South America . He participated only to expeditions on the eastern coast of South America , and was not even in command of all of those expeditions . Many other explorers found different parts of the continent before and after him .

The actual nature of the metalsemiconductor junction was noted by Hans Bethe. * Simpson 's paradox , a term introduced by Colin R. Blyth in 1972 ; but Edward Simpson did not actually discover this statistical paradox . * Snell 's law of refraction , named after Willebrord Snellius , a Dutch scientist , also known as Descartes law of refraction ( after Ren Descartes ) was discovered by Ibn Sahl. * Stokes 's theorem discovered by Lord Kelvin * Stigler 's Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TU # * The Tetralogy of Fallot was described in 1672 by Niels Stensen , but named after tienne-Louis Arthur Fallot who also described it in 1888. * Taylor 's law in ecology was discovered by H. Fairfield Smith in 1938 but named after L. R. Taylor who rediscovered it in 1961. # V # * Venn diagrams are named after John Venn , who popularized them in the 1880s , but Leonhard Euler had already introduced them in 1768. * Vigenre cipher was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book ' ' La cifra del . Sig . Giovan Battista Bellaso ' ' , but later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenre in the 19th century . * Voronoi diagrams are named after Georgy Voronoy , who defined and studied the general n-dimensional case in 1908 , but have already been used by Descartes ( 1644 ) , Lejeune Dirichlet ( 1850 ) and Snow ( 1854 ) . # WX # * Wang tiles were hypothesized by Hao Wang not to exist , but an example was constructed by his student Robert Berger . * Wheatstone bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1833 , but named after Sir Charles Wheatstone who improved and popularized it in 1843. * Wike 's law of low odd primes , a principle of design of experiments , was stated by Sir Ronald A. Fisher in 1935 but named by Edwin Wike in 1973. # YZ # * Yagi-Uda antenna , a successful and popular beam antenna , whose primary inventor was Shintaro Uda , but which was popularized by , and formerly popularly named for , his collaborator Hidetsugu Yagi. # Similar cases # * BaileyBorweinPlouffe formula was discovered by Simon Plouffe , who has since expressed regret at having to share credit for his discovery .
