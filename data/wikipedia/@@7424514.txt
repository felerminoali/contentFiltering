Tosh returns to the Hub where Owen reveals he had misidentified the skeleton , and now knows it to be a man that died of an unidentified trauma . Tosh speaks to Jack about the name Philoctetes , which Jack recognizes as a reference to Greek mythology ; Philoctetes was an archer who was exiled on the island of Lemnos during the Trojan War . Tosh returns to Mary later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton . When Tosh is unable to provide her any answers , Mary convinces Tosh to ask the others at the Hub , using the pendant as they may be hiding information from her . Tosh finds Owen lacks any information on the artifact , while she is unable to read Jack 's mind . Meanwhile , Owen has discovered that the same trauma that inflicted the skeleton has been reported several times in the last few centuries , while Jack becomes aware of Tosh 's strange behavior . When Tosh returns to Mary , she reveals herself as an alien , an exiled dissident , and that the artifact is a transporter that can help her to leave the planet . Tosh offers Torchwood 's services to Mary , but she refuses , and instead asks Tosh to take her to Torchwood so she can retrieve the artifact herself . At the Hub , they find that Jack has deduced that Mary is an alien and the murderer of the skeleton and others through the century . Jack explains that the artifact is a transporter for a guard and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1812 , Mary was able to kill her guard and took the body of a human woman , killing others to keep her human form . Mary holds Tosh at knife point , demanding the artifact . Jack , now aware of Tosh 's telepathic abilities , instruct Tosh to remain still as he makes the trade with Mary . As soon as Mary takes the artifact , she and it disappear ; Jack explains he programmed the device to transport her directly to the center of the sun . Owen and Gwen apologize to Tosh for their behavior to her . Jack offers Tosh the pendant for herself , but she smashes it underfoot . Tosh tells Jack in private that attempting to read his mind produced only silence , like that of a dead man . # Continuity # * The officer is killed in 1812 ( per caption ) , and Toshiko calculates his skeleton has been there for 196 years , 11 to 11 1/2 months , placing the episode in 2009 with the concurrent ' ' Doctor Who ' ' timeline . This is in potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cardiff in 1941 and says he has made the city his home for sixty-six years ( he also explained that he was taken out to the countryside upon arrival in 1941 , so the 66 years ' ' could ' ' be counted from his subsequent return to the city ) . * A pair of 3-D glasses , originally used by the Tenth Doctor in Doomsday and seen in Small Worlds , makes another fleeting appearance . Also visible is a rifle used against the Daleks in Doomsday , and a replica of the Doctor 's sonic screwdriver can be seen on Toshiko 's desk . The Sycorax Leader 's staff and sword from ' ' Doctor Who ' ' episode The Christmas Invasion are visible next to the Doomsday Rifle . Presumably the sword was retrieved with the severed hand of the Doctor or from The Sycorax Leader with the staff . * A man of questionable mental state is said to be having visions of Cybermen. * Jack has asked Toshiko to prepare a list for UNIT , the first verbal mention of that organisation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack explains that UNIT wants Torchwood to handle a certain alien problem , and Jack wants Tosh to draw up a list of reasons why they can't. * Jack speaks to the Prime Minister on the telephone asking why documents listing Torchwood operations are being given to the opposition , believed to be Harold Saxon ( i.e. , the Master ) . This may explain how the Master knows about Jack in the ' ' Doctor Who ' ' episode The Sound of Drums , and how the Master is able to send the rest of the Torchwood team on what he describes as a wild goose chase in the same episode . * Some scan images of the Cyberwoman are in the autopsy room where the body they find is being held . * Toshiko now knows about the affair between Gwen and Owen , first seen at the end of Countrycide . * An alien of the same race as Mary appears in ' ' The Sarah Jane Adventures ' ' pilot episode Invasion of the Bane , albeit this time as a star poet . The episode clarifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are largely a peaceful race . Although this particular species has been referenced in the Torchwood novel ' ' Something in the Water ' ' as Arcateenians , the Sarah Jane website originally referred to this alien species as the Butterfly People . * Mary recites Toshiko 's biographical summary to her , stating that Toshiko was born in London in July 1975 , and that her grandfather had worked at Bletchley Park . Toshiko 's personnel record , shown in Exit Wounds , records her birth date as 18 September 1981 . Toshiko 's grandfather , a Japanese man , being able to work at Bletchley Park is inconsistent with both reality and her paranoia about being captured when transported to 1941 in Captain Jack Harkness . # Music # *The songs Spitting Games by Snow Patrol ( when Mary introduces herself to Toshiko , last heard in Everything Changes ) , Sing by Travis ( when Tosh tells Mary about alien cultures &amp; artefacts , last heard in Ghost Machine ) , Drag by Placebo ( when Mary tells Tosh about the pendant and tells her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when Mary kisses Tosh in the cafe then asks about the object from the building site ) are featured in this episode . # Outside references # * The phrase Beware Greeks bearing gifts refers to the Trojan horse described in Virgil 's The Aeneid. * James Bond and the film ' ' Alien ' ' are referenced. * Jack makes a reference to the American television series ' ' Quincy , M.E. ' ' when Owen is first examining the skeleton at the building site ( Good job , Quincy ) . * Mary quotes the poem ' ' Kubla Khan ' ' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge . The historical Kublai Khan appeared in the First Doctor serial ' ' Marco Polo ' ' ( 1964 ) . * The overheard thought Six cigarettes today and all of them post-coital .. glorious . is a quote from ' ' Bridget Jones 's Diary ' ' . * When Tosh enters the autopsy room , Gwen sings a part of Dem Bones to Owen ( The leg bone 's connected to the .. hip bone ) after his prediction about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proven entirely false ( it is a male with unknown chest trauma , with only GSW ruled out ) . * Gwen teases Owen by calling him Amanda Burton , in reference to that actress 's role as a pathologist in the BBC drama series ' ' Silent Witness ' ' . She also imitates the sound played when contestants give an incorrect answer in the game show ' ' Family Fortunes ' ' . * There are at least five versions of the story of Philoctetes
