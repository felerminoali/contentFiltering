The Battle of the Dalmatian Channels was a three-day confrontation between three tactical groups of Yugoslav Navy ships and coastal artillery , and a detachment of naval commandos of the Croatian Navy fought on 1416 November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . On 14 November , the commandos torpedoed a ' ' Mirna ' ' -class patrol boat P-176 ' ' Mukos ' ' close to the island of Bra in the Split Channel of the Adriatic Sea , prompting a Yugoslav naval bombardment of Bra and olta Island the same day . The drifting ' ' Mukos ' ' was salvaged by Croatian civilian boats and was beached at Neujam bay . The next day , a group of Yugoslav Navy vessels deployed to the Split Channel , organised into the Katela tactical group ( TG ) and bombarded the city of Split in retaliation for the loss of ' ' Mukos ' ' . In return , Croatian coastal artillery engaged the Katela TG . To draw off some of the artillery fire , the Yugoslav Navy deployed another group of vessels from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of olta where the TG was engaged by more Croatian artillery . The Katela TG retreated east and joined with the Ploe TG consisting of three minesweepers . On 16 November , the combined Yugoslav force sailed through the Korula Channel a strait separating the islands of Hvar and Korula to reach safety at the Yugoslav Navy base at Vis . The warships were then engaged by Croatian coastal artillery deployed on Korula and the Peljeac Peninsula , losing two minesweepers to the artillery fire in the process . The battle marked the last deployment of the Yugoslav Navy into one of the Dalmatian channels , the loosening of the naval blockade of the Croatian coast imposed in September and the largest Croatian Navy operation in the war . The Croatian Navy later towed the grounded ' ' Mukos ' ' to ibenik , repaired the vessel and put her into service as OB-62 ' ' olta ' ' . During the battle , 22 Yugoslav Navy crewmen , two Croatian gunners and two civilian sailors in Split were killed .

The convoy of 40 small boats led by the ferry ' ' Slavija ' ' was on its way to resupply Dubrovnik and retrieve refugees from the besieged city . # Order of battle # Despite the capture of the Yugoslav Navy vessels in September , Croatia 's coastal defences relied on captured coastal artillery on the mainland and List of islands of Croatia The Yugoslav Navy deployed three tactical groups ( TGs ) named Katela , Vis and Ploe off the coast of central Dalmatia from its bases on the islands of Vis ( island ) # Timeline # # 14 November # On 15 November at 6:42 a.m. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Split and on the islands of Bra and olta .

The JNA based in Split did not join the bombardment . In response to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of olta and Bra , the Vis TG led by ' ' Pula ' ' sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Katela TG . As the ships approached the Split Entrance , they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed . ' ' Pula ' ' , attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September , requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection .
