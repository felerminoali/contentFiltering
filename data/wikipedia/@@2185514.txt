The City Of Ten Thousand Buddhas ( , Vietnamese : ' ' Cha Vn Pht Thnh Thnh ' ' ) is an international Buddhist community and monastery founded by Hsuan Hua , an important figure in Western Buddhism . It is one of the first Chinese Zen Buddhist temples in the United States , and one of the largest Buddhist communities in the Western Hemisphere . The city is situated in Talmage , Mendocino County , California about 2 mi east of Ukiah , and 110 miles ( 180 km ) north of San Francisco . It was one of the first Buddhist monasteries built in the United States . The temple follows the Guiyang Ch'an School , one of the five houses of classical Chinese Ch'an . The city is noted for their close adherence to the ' ' vinaya ' ' , the austere traditional Buddhist monastic code . # History # The Dharma Realm Buddhist Association purchased the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas site in 1974 and established an international center there by 1976 . Originally the site housed the Mendocino State Hospital founded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand rooms of various sizes , three gymnasiums , a fire station , a swimming pool , a refuse incinerator , fire hydrants , and various other facilities . A paved road wound its way through the complex , lined with tall street lamps and trees over a hundred years old . The connections for electricity and pipes for water , heating , and air conditioning were all underground . Both the architectural design and the materials used for the buildings were state of the art . The heating and air conditioning were centrally controlled . Considering the natural surroundings to be ideal for cultivation , Hua visited the valley three times and negotiated with the seller many times . He wanted to establish a center for propagating the Buddhadharma throughout the world and for introducing the Buddhist teachings , which originated in the East , to the Western world . Hua planned to create a major center for world Buddhism , and an international orthodox monastery for the purpose of elevating moral standards and raising people 's awareness . The city comprises 488 acres ( 2 km ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are developed . The rest of the land includes meadows , orchards , and forests . Large institutional buildings and smaller residential houses are scattered over the west side of the campus . The main Buddha hall , monastic facilities , educational institutes , administrative offices , the main kitchen and dining hall , Jyun Kang Vegetarian Restaurant , and supporting structures are all located in this complex . In 2009 , the walls of the Long Life Hall were subject to structural damage caused by an electrical fire . However , no major damage occurred to the altar , artwork or statues inside the hall . # Sites of interest # * The Jeweled Hall of 10,000 Buddhas : Finished in 1982 , the hall is adorned with streamers , banners , lamps and is graced in the center by the presence of an 20-foot ( 6 m ) statue of a thousand-handed Avalokitevara Bodhisattva , popularly known as Guan Yin Pusa in Chinese and Chenrezig in Tibetan . Rows of yellow bowing cushions are lined upon the red carpet . Walls are adorned with 10,000 images of the Buddha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is where Hua often held classes for his disciples in the early years of the city . The abbot 's quarters , where Hua dwelled , were on the second floor . This was also where Hua lay in state during the 49-day mourning period . Now , it is a memorial hall that contains relics of the Buddha , Master Hsu Yun , and Hua . It is closed to the public and opened on special days . * Dharma Realm Buddhist University : In order to raise the level of education among Sangha members and train people to propagate Buddhism , Hua founded the Dharma Realm Buddhist University in 1976 . The university aims to educate students to become wise and virtuous leaders in the world . Instead of merely transmitting academic knowledge , it emphasizes a foundation in virtue , which expands into the study of how to help all living beings discover their inherent nature . The university is working for accreditation in the near future , though no specific timetable has yet been announced . * Jyun Kang Vegetarian Restaurant : The university canteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve healthful nutritious food full of the good karma of non-harming. * Tathagata ( ' ' Rulai ' ' ) Monastery : The dorm rooms for monks ( left home persons ) and male lay persons persuaded toward the monastic lifestyle . * Great Compassion Courtyard : Dorm rooms for guests and visitors . * Bell and Drum House : Houses the instruments that are played daily to ready monastics for daily practice . * Institute for the Translation of Buddhist Texts : This facility was active in the early years at the city as a center for translation and as a residence hall for nuns and laywomen . The Institute has since moved to Burlingame , California . * Tower of Blessings : Hua allocated the Tower of Blessings as a home for the elderly monastics residing in the city . * Wonderful Words Hall : Site for daily gatherings to listen to Hua 's taped lectures in the 10,000 Buddhas Hall . * Five Contemplations Dining Hall : Completed in 1982 , it is where the monastics and resident lay community follow the formal monastic style in taking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the hall can seat over 3,000 people . * Instilling Goodness Elementary and Developing Virtue Secondary Schools : The elementary ( kindergarten through 6th grade ) and secondary ( 7th grade through 12th grade ) schools were founded by Hua in 1976 . The schools are divided into two divisions , Boys and Girls , and teach such classes as meditation , yoga , Buddhism , and World Religions . Many foreign and non-local students also reside on campus in school dorms for the duration of the school year ( excepting Winter , Spring , and Summer vacations ) . As of Spring 2006 , there were about 130 students in both divisions . * Organic Farm : A ten-acre CCOF-certified organic farm , whose produce supplements the meals in the dining hall . # Traditions held at the monastery # Two distinguishing features of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas are that unlike many other Chinese Buddhist monasteries , the monastics always wear their kasaya sashes ( long sashes that are worn outside the monastic clothing ) , and they eat only one meal a day and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rest , not lying down to sleep . Monastics at the city do not have any social lives , nor do men and women intermingle . Whereas many ordinary Chinese monks go out to perform rituals for events such as weddings or funerals , none of these monks do so . Some monastics even choose to maintain a vow of silence , for varying periods of time . They wear a tag saying No Talking and do not speak with anyone . There are monks and nuns who maintain the precept of not owning personal wealth and not touching money , thus eliminating the thought of money and increasing their purity of mind . Master Hua often reminded his disciples , ' ' In cultivation , we have to stick to our principles ! We ca n't forget our principles . Our principles are our goal . Once we recognize our goal , forward we go ! We 've got to be brave and vigorous . We ca n't retreat . As long as we are vigorous and not lax in ordinary times , we could become enlightened any minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let ourselves be confused by thoughts , and miss the opportunity to get enlightened . ' ' # Atmosphere # The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is a strict Buddhist monastery adhering to the traditional Asian monastic culture although it is located in a liberal area of California . The organic farm and peaceful way of life appeals to most Westerners who want an alternate lifestyle . This creates an interesting mix of different ideologies . While the traditionalists are more drawn to the spiritual and devotional side of Buddhism , Westerners are often more interested in meditation . Some of the boarding school children are Westerners from the local community who want their children to grow up in a community-oriented place , while some of the children come from Taiwan and Mainland China , even from European countries , such as France , Belgium , and Holland , where parents think highly of Hua . The liberalism of Westerners and the strict traditionalism of Easterners may clash at times . Unique to the City , the monastery houses both male and female Sangha , students from the boarding school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mainland China , Taiwan , and in the West house only monks or only nuns but not both , and are closed to the public . However , males and females have separate campuses , with gender-neutral buildings in the middle of the campus . # Guiding Principles and Customs # Hua set up the six principles for all monastics and lay practitioners to follow as guidelines for spiritual development . These principles were to not fight , to not be greedy , to not seek , to not be selfish , to not pursue personal advantage , and to not lie . Since spiritual development is a full-time endeavor , certain rules and customs are followed by the community : *Different sections of the campus are designated for men or women , and generally the genders do not co-mingle . This is particularly noticeable at ceremonies and meals , where men and women separate into different sections . *Out of respect to the lifestyle of the monastics , modest clothing is worn by the laity at all times . *Smoking , drug use , and the consumption of meat products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Unlike in many temples found in Asia , no incense is ever offered personally by any of the lay practitioners and guests . Hua believed that it was totally superstitious to insist on personally offering incense to the Buddhas , and pointed out that high-quality incense is expensive while poor incense can ruin the walls and statues . Instead , a single stick of incense is offered by a monastic for the entire assembly , and then all practitioners would simply bow and pay respects . # Wildlife # Many animals roam the grounds of the City , including peacocks , deer , squirrels , and other species . The peacocks are generally quite accustomed to the presence of people and are tame . Peacocks pose a large problem on the farm , so countermeasures have been taken against the peacocks , including covering the plants , moving the peacocks to a walnut farm , and planting extra food based on the assumption that a significant fraction will be eaten or damaged by peacocks . During special Dharma Assemblies , a Liberating of Life ceremony is held where many animals - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set free . # Daily schedule # # Morning # *4:00-5:00 : Morning Recitation *5:00-6:00 : Universal Bowing *6:00-7:00 : Meditation / Self-study *6:15-6:45 : Breakfast *7:00-8:00 : Avatamsaka Sutra recitation in Chinese *8:00-10:30 : Classes , study or work *10:30-12:00 : Meal Offering / Lunch # Evening # *6:30-7:30 : Evening Recitation *7:30-9:40 : Lecture/Closing recitation # Largest temple in the Western Hemisphere # Another temple known as Hsi Lai Temple , located in Hacienda Heights , a city in Southern California , has claimed since 1988 that they are the largest Buddhist temple in the western hemisphere . However , the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas has over 80 acre of built-up land on 488 acre of property as compared to Hsi Lai Temples ' 15 acre , but rather than a temple complex as is Hsi Lai Temple , the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is more of an entire community with several large buildings clustered together . Therefore , it is unclear which is the largest , as there is a significant difference between the structure and location of the two Buddhist organizations .
