archipelago = The distant bird island are an 8 km  2  total area uninhabited atoll . Its dry land area however is mostly made up by 3 concrete encasings amounting to over 8000 m  2  ; it furthermore has a 5000 m  2  platform in its lagoon housing a research station . It is located on the Palau-Kyushu Ridge in the Philippine Sea at , 534km mi SE of Oki Dait and 567km mi WSW of Minami Iwo Jima of the Ogasawara Islands or 1740km mi south of Tokyo , Japan . The Japanese meaning of the name is remote bird islands and they are sometimes referred to as the southernmost islands of Japan . # Etymology # The atoll has multiple designations in English ( Okinotori coral reefs , Okinotori Islands ) . Its original name was Parece Vela , Spanish for looks like a sail ( alluding to the original appearance of the reef ) . This name has been retained in English as well , especially to designate the geological formations of the islets. # History # It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torre in 1543 , certainly by Miguel Lpez de Legazpi in 1565 , and its first recorded name was Parece Vela ( looks like a sail in Spanish ) . In 1789 , William Douglas arrived with British ship ' ' Iphigenia ' ' and , in the following year , the place was named ' ' Douglas Reef ' ' ( also spelt ' ' Douglass Reef ' ' ) . The existence of the atoll might not have been known by the Japanese until 1888 . In 1922 and 1925 , the Japanese navy ship ' Manshu ' ' investigated the area . In 1931 , confirming that no other countries had claimed the reefs , Japan declared it Japanese territory , placing it under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo Metropolis , classifying it as part of the Ogasawara Village , and naming it ' ' Okinotorishima ' ' . During 1939 and 1941 a foundation was completed for a lighthouse and a meteorological observation site ; however , construction was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II . After Japan 's defeat , the United States assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands to Japan in 1968 . Between 1987 and 1993 the government of Tokyo and later the central government built steel breakwaters and concrete walls , to stop the erosion of Okinotorishima , which today leaves only three of the five rocks that were present in 1939 above water ; in 1988 the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center built a marine investigation facility which it has since maintained following typhoon damage . On March 16 , 2007 , a light beacon was installed by the Japan Coast Guard . The beacon is plotted on the hydrographic chart . # Geology # Geologically , the islets are an atoll , built on the Kyushu-Palau Ridge , the westernmost part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc System . The name Parece Vela has been given to the extinct back-arc basin that lies immediately to the east ( the northern half of this back-arc basin is known as the Shikoku Basin ) . This back-arc basin formed by seafloor spreading between late Oligocene and Miocene . The Parece Vela Basin contains the longest megamullion in the world . The original Spanish name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Parece Vela megamullion , Parece Vela ridge , Parece Vela rift or Parece Vela basin . The waters around the reefs are potentially rich in oil and other resources and it lies in an area of potential military significance . At high tide , one area of the reefs is roughly the size of a twin bed and pokes just 7.4 centimeters ( 2.9 inches ) out of the ocean . The other is the size of a small bedroom and rises about twice as high . The entire reef consists of approximately 7.8km2 sqmi , most of which is submerged even at low tide . The area has three tiny individual islets : *Higashi-Kojima ( , Eastern Islet ) *Kita-Kojima ( , Northern Islet ) , nevertheless rather in the ' ' West ' ' *Minami-Kojima ( , Southern Islet ) Minami-Kojima is a completely artificial islet created in shallow water . But also the two original islets appear completely artificial today , with little if any trace of the two natural rocks that still appear on photographs of 1987 . In 1925 , there were still five above-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 mentions five above-water rocks . Three smaller ones were on the west side , nearly impossible to see from seaward because of the breaking waves . The larger rocks on the southwest side and on the northeast side , possibly Kita-Kojima and Higashi-Kojima , were reported to be 0.6 m ( 2 ft ) and 0.4 m ( 16 inches ) high , respectively . The original rocks appeared barren , obviously without any terrestrial vegetation . The current artificial dry land areas with their concrete surfaces appear unfit to support terrestrial vegetation either . After concrete encasing , each of the islets appears as a circle with a diameter of 60 meters ( about 200 ft ) on detailed satellite images , which would correspond to a land areaalbeit mostly artificialof 2827 m  2  ( 0.7 acres ) per islet , or 8482 m  2  ( 2.1 acres ) in total . In addition , there is a platform on stilts in the shallow part of the lagoon 140 meters ( 460 ft ) ENE of the southern islet , built by the Japan Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rectangle of 100 m by 50 m ( 330 ft by 165 ft ) . The platform has a helicopter landing pad and a large three-story building with a marine investigation facility and a meteorological station . The rocks are in the western part of a lagoon surrounded by a submerged coral reef , over which the waves break , and that extends 4.5km mi east-west and 1.7km mi north-south , with an area of roughly 5 km within the rim of the reef . The lagoon is 3 to 4.6 meters deep , but there are numerous coral heads of lesser depths throughout the area . The fringing reef of the atoll is pear-shaped in an east-west direction with its greatest width at the eastern end . There is a small boat channel into the lagoon in the southwest , about 15 meters ( 50 ft ) wide and 6 meters ( 20 ft ) deep , 250 meters ( 800 ft ) southeast of the artificial islet. # Administration # Administratively , the island is considered part of Ogasawara village , Tokyo . In 1939 , the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended in 1941 , at the start of the World War II hostilities in the Pacific . Typhoons are constant threats to Okinotori 's existence . In the 1970s there were about five or six visible protrusions , but by 1989 , only two were visible . In order to prevent the island from submersion caused by erosion and maintain the claim to the EEZ , the Japanese government launched an embankment building project in 1987 , and Higashikojima and Kitakojima were surrounded by concrete . Japan has encased the reefs with $280 million worth of concrete and covered the smaller one with a $50 million titanium net to shield it from debris thrown up by the ocean 's waves . In fact , the Japanese government has spent over $600 million fortifying the reefs to prevent them from being completely washed away . Furthermore , the Nippon Foundation has drawn plans to build a lighthouse and increase the size of the reef by breeding microorganisms known as foraminifera . Creating land using the microorganisms could take decades to a century before the island is large enough to be useful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , as well as repair work on the embankment . In 2005 , the government installed a radar system ( at the cost of 330 million ) , repaired a heliport , and placed an official address plaque saying , 1 Okinotori Island , Ogasawara Village , Tokyo in Japanese . Fishing expeditions are also sent to support the claim of economic activity . Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara has talked of building a power station , despite protests by environmentalists . His government has helped fund expeditions to Okinotori by Japanese fishermen and scientists . Governor Ishihara himself toured the islands on May 20 , 2005 to inspect the conservation and management efforts , went snorkeling to see firsthand the condition of the surrounding waters , and released Japanese horse mackerel fry to show support for the local fishing industry . The islands are an intermittent rallying point for Japanese nationalists , and , as such , a hot-button political issue in Japan . # EEZ Dispute # On 22 April 2004 , Chinese diplomats stated during bilateral talks with Japan that they regarded Okinotorishima as an atoll , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) stemming from Okinotorishima . Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , an island is a naturally formed area of land , surrounded by water , which is above water at high tide . It states that rocks which can not sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone . Japan signed the Convention in 1983 ; the Convention came into force in 19941996 for Japan . Japan claims an EEZ over 400,000 square km ( 154,500 square miles ) around Okinotorishima . The People 's Republic of China disputes this claim , saying the area only consists of rocks and not islands . The PRC has not made a territorial claim of its own regarding Okinotorishima , but foreign policy analysts note that it wants to investigate the surrounding seabed for submarine operations in case of military conflict involving the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) . The territory lies at a militarily strategic point , midway between Taiwan and Guam , the latter where U.S. forces are based . Vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean 's bottom over which U.S. warships might pass on their way to Taiwan . The PRC conducted four maritime surveys near the Okinotori coral reefs in 2001 , two in 2002 , and one in 2003 . However , the number of such incidents rose to four in 2004 . These incidents have drawn protests from Japan . Jon Van Dyke , a law professor , has suggested that the situation is similar to the failed British attempt to claim an EEZ around Rockall , an uninhabited granite outcropping in the Atlantic Ocean . The UK eventually dropped its claim in the 1990s when other countries objected . Dr. Dyke has further asserted that it is impossible to make a plausible claim that Okinotorishima should be able to generate a 200 nautical-mile zone . Tadao Kuribayashi , another law professor , disagrees , arguing in part that rocks and reefs differ in composition and structure , and that the intent of the provision was geared toward the former .
