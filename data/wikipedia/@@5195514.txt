Westdale Mall was an enclosed super-regional shopping mall in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . The two-level mall on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids is one of the city 's two enclosed malls , along with Lindale Mall on the city 's northeast side . In recent years , Westdale has taken on some characteristics of a dead mall as two of its four anchor stores and an estimated 70 percent of inline stores have been vacated as of January 2013 . At the beginning of 2013 , local investor group A. Shapiro LLC purchased Westdale Mall and , under the management of the Frew Development Group , plans to invest $90 million in redeveloping the property . # History # # Planning and construction # Plans for Westdale Mall were first announced on March 29 , 1972 . Original plans called for a 560000sqftm2 -3 mall with two or three anchor stores and 30 to 50 smaller stores on 66 acre of land . Later that year , developer Ernest W. Hahn of The Hahn Company acquired the mall 's property from Midwest Development of Cedar Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hahn asked the Cedar Rapids City Council to rezone an additional 21 acre of land from residential to commercial use . An organization of citizens known as Taxpayers for Sensible Planning opposed the rezoning , claiming that construction of a larger mall would have a severe impact on existing businesses in the Cedar Rapids area . Despite the opposition , the City Council approved the rezoning by a 4-1 vote on May 22 , 1974 . The recession of 1974 delayed the start of construction until May 1976 and a seven-week electricians ' strike delayed the mall 's opening to October 4 , 1979 . Despite the construction problems and layoffs in Cedar Rapids ' manufacturing sector during the recession of 1980 , Westdale Mall was at 93 percent capacity with 114 stores by the beginning of 1981 . Westdale attracted shoppers from counties throughout eastern Iowa and surrounding states , including cities such as Davenport and Waterloo that already had enclosed malls. # Anchor and ownership changes # JCPenney , Montgomery Ward , Younkers , and Brandeis signed on as anchors before construction of Westdale Mall began , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under construction . Wards and JCPenney , which both relocated from downtown Cedar Rapids , were the first two anchor stores to open while Younkers and Petersen Harned Von Maur ( Brandeis ' replacement ) opened in 1980 . Wards closed in early 2001 as the chain ceased operations , and the anchor space remained vacant for more than four years until Steve &amp; Barry 's opened there in November 2005 . On January 31 , 2007 , Von Maur closed its Westdale Mall store due to a decline in business and offered its 80 employees positions at its Lindale Mall and Iowa City locations . That anchor space remains vacant . Steve and Barry 's closed in November 2008 due to the chain 's bankruptcy , leaving Westdale with only two anchors at the beginning of 2010 . Westdale Mall was built by The Hahn Company , which became TrizecHahn in 1980 ; TrizecHahn sold Westdale to The Rouse Company in April 1998 . The Festival Companies of Los Angeles , California , took over management of Westdale in November 2004 . Shortly after that , Festival announced a $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new food court . However , those plans never materialized as tenants continued to leave the mall amid competition from Coral Ridge Mall 20mi km to the south . In November 2006 , Westdale was placed in administrative receivership after H-N-W Associates , a part-owner of the mall , fell behind on its mortgage payments . Heritage Property Management of Cedar Rapids took over management of the mall at the time . In December 2006 , General Growth Properties ( owner of Coral Ridge Mall ) took over the leasing duties for the mall . Westdale was sold to Cedar Rapids Properties , Inc. , in a sheriff 's sale on July 10 , 2007 . The former Steve &amp; Barry 's space , which was originally owned by Montgomery Ward when it was an anchor , was separately owned by California-based City Gate LP . General Growth handed the leasing duties over to Jones Lang LaSalle in mid-2010 . By March 2007 , over 50% of the mall stores had closed . The Cedar Rapids City Council voted to delay any major redevelopment work at the mall for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property does not break it apart . On May 9 , 2007 , the City Council voted 7-1 to lift the moratorium on a mostly vacant outparcel building that was originally built as an Econofoods supermarket and was more recently a Big Lots store ; two local developers planned to reconfigure that building and build a Sonic Drive-In and T.G.I. Friday 's on the property . However in September 2007 T.G.I. Friday 's canceled its plans to open a restaurant at that location amid concerns that they would not make enough money there . Sonic also backed out of its plan to open a restaurant at that location shortly after that . The city council later reimposed the development moratorium before they unanimously agreed to set it aside on December 19 , 2007 . The Big Lots outparcel building was demolished in March 2010 to make room for Edgewood Station , a new 25000sqftm2 -3 development that is expected to include at least two restaurants and a financial institution . # Flood of 2008 and aftermath # Some of Westdale Mall 's empty stores had been used as temporary homes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa flood of 2008 . Disaster centers for the American Red Cross , FEMA , and the Small Business Administration were also set up at Westdale . After rejecting an $18.5 million offer to buy Westdale outright on January 21 , 2009 , the Linn County Board of Supervisors agreed to move their offices to the former Steve &amp; Barry 's space on February 11 , 2009 . In June 2010 , Linn County signed a lease agreement to keep its Linn County West office complex at Westdale until at least February 2012 . The Linn County offices that were housed at Westdale moved back to downtown Cedar Rapids in June 2012 . On February 9 , 2009 , the Cedar Rapids Public Library opened a temporary library known as The Bridge inside space that was formerly the home of an Osco Drug store at Westdale . The Bridge is serving as the main operations for the library , whose main branch downtown was heavily damaged by the flood , until a permanent decision on the library 's future is made .

Shapiro LLC , an investor group led by local realtor Scott Byers , acquired Westdale Mall in a transaction that took effect on January 1 , 2013 . Leasing duties were handed over to the Denver-based Frew Development Group as part of the sale . A. Shapiro plans to invest $90 million to redevelop the Westdale Mall site . Plans call for demolishing most of the current mall except for the JCPenney , Younkers , and vacant Von Maur anchors , and turning the site into a multiuse destination similar to the Streets at Southglenn in Colorado and Jordan Creek Town Center in Des Moines . While the mall remains open , redevelopment was expected to begin in the first quarter of 2013 with the demolition of the former Montgomery Ward/Steve &amp; Barry 's building . The mall remained open until March 31 , 2014 , at which point all tenants moved out except for J. C. Penney , Younkers , and a City Looks hair salon .
