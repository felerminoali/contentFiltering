' ' Accidental Life ' ' ( ' ' Sluajni ivot ' ' ) is a 1969 Croatian drama film directed by Ante Peterli , starring Dragutin Klobuar , Ivo Serdar , Ana Kari and Zvonimir Rogoz . ' ' Accidental Life ' ' , an existential study of ordinary lives led by two alienated urban white collar workers , was the debut feature film of Ante Peterli , Croatian film theorist and film critic . The film received mediocre reviews and went largely unnoticed after its release , but has been reevaluated decades later as one of the best Croatian films ever made . # Plot # Filip ( Dragutin Klobuar ) and Stanko ( Ivo Serdar ) are two young clerks who share an office in a nondescript company . The two are also amateur rowers who train together . Their personalities are quite different : while Filip is fastidious , serious in relationships with women , and somewhat introverted and sensitive , Stanko is a womanizer and prone to shirking his duties at work . Still , they spend most of they time together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office during the day , and going out in the evening looking for female company - all trying desperately to escape from the tedium of everyday life . They see their senior colleague Jurak ( Zvonimir Rogoz ) as a dinosaur , dreading the possibility of becoming like him as they grow older . Filip falls in love with an attractive female coworker and , as the events gradually unfold , differences in character between the two men create a simmering conflict .. # Background and production # By the time Ante Peterli set out to direct ' ' Accidental Life ' ' , his debut feature film , he was already well known as a prominent young film critic , and a professor of film theory at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb . In the 1960s he directed his first short TV drama , and was active as an assistant director in several feature films and documentaries , working also as a script doctor . The role of Stanko was initially intended for Zvonimir rnko , but he was busy shooting a TV series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that Klobuar was better suited for the character of Filip , the more introverted protagonist , so Stanko 's role ultimately went to Ivo Serdar . Due to budget constraints , the film was shot quickly , with a small crew . Peterli likened the near-amateur filming conditions to those prevalent in the French New Wave , his main influence at the time . Still , he saw ' ' Accidental Life ' ' as a work that , rather than being a New Wave film ' ' per se ' ' , projects a New-Wave-like atmosphere by striving to tell the truth about its times and about my generation by using a more modern way of storytelling . # Themes # Croatian film critic Jurica Pavii describes ' ' Accidental Life ' ' as typical in many respects for the Croatian cinema of the late 1960s , which was increasingly moving away from historical , rural settings and adopting urban themes and sensibilities . The two protagonists are members of the lost generation who are urban loners with no ambition or direction in life . They are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with no past , which makes them an oddity in a still traditional society which highly values family background and kinship . The film 's portrayal of a faceless , dehumanized workplace is highly reminiscent of ' ' Il Posto ' ' , a 1961 film by Ermanno Olmi . ' ' Accidental Life ' ' thus largely reflected the modernist sensibilities of its era , but opted for a classicist visual approach . As a fan of Howard Hawks and John Ford , Peterli preferred the subtle , invisible style of directing - using simple , functional shots - over the more extravagant modernist film techniques . # Reception # ' ' Accidental Life ' ' was shown at the Pula Film Festival , receiving mediocre reviews from the critics . During its five-week theatrical run in Gri Cinema in Zagreb , the film 's earnings recovered its budget . Despite receiving multiple recommendations in ' ' Cahiers du cinma ' ' , the renowned French film magazine , it went largely unnoticed in Yugoslavia . A possible reason for the film 's tepid reception is because it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinema of the era : it was far from populist storytelling , yet - with its absence of pronounced symbolism , original motifs , or more extravagant camera and editing work - seemed too bland for the proponents of modernist cinema . Peterli 's student and fellow film theorist Hrvoje Turkovi found some reactions to the film to be malicious , arguing that Peterli 's earlier work as a film critic motivated many to use the opportunity to get even . Peterli did not return to directing , and ' ' Accidental Life ' ' remained his only feature film . As his academic career was taking off , he felt that it made no sense to pursue film directing , a field in which his contributions were not appreciated . Ultimately , Peterli came to be best known for his scholarly work , which earned him the title of the father of Croatian film studies . Largely forgotten for decades , ' ' Accidental Life ' ' has been reevaluated in a much more favorable light in the 1990s , when it began to appear in several critics ' all-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among 44 Croatian film critics and film historians , ' ' Accidental Life ' ' placed 17th in the list of all-time best Croatian films .
