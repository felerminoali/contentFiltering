In New Zealand the Speaker of the House of Representatives is the individual who chairs the country 's legislative body , the New Zealand House of Representatives ( often also referred to as ' Parliament ' ) . The Speaker fulfils a number of important functions in relation to the operation of the House , which is based upon the British Westminster Parliamentary system . The current speaker is David Carter . # Role # # In the Debating Chamber # The Speaker 's most visible role is that of presiding over the House when in session . This involves overseeing the order in which business is conducted , and determining who should speak at what time . The Speaker is also responsible for granting or declining requests for certain events , such as a snap debate on a particular issue . An important part of the Speaker 's role is ruling on matters of procedure known as ' Points of order ' based on Standing Orders and previously made Speakers ' rulings .

Only three people have held the office despite not being from the governing party . In 1923 , Charles Statham ( an independent , but formerly a member of the Reform Party ) was backed by Reform so as not to endanger the party 's slim majority , and later retained his position under the Liberal Party . In 1993 , Peter Tapsell ( a member of the Labour Party ) was backed by the National Party for the same reason . Bill Barnard , who had been elected Speaker in 1936 , resigned from the Labour Party in 1940 but retained his position . Historically , a Speaker lost the right to cast a vote , except when both sides were equally balanced .

If the office of Speaker becomes vacant during a parliamentary term , the House must elect a new Speaker when it next sits . The election of a Speaker is presided over by the Clerk of the House . It is not unusual for an election to be contested . If there are two candidates , members vote in the lobbies for their preferred candidate . In the case of three or more candidates , a roll-call vote is conducted and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated , with the process continuing ( or reverting to a two-way run-off ) until one candidate has a majority . Members may vote only if they are present in person : no proxy votes are permitted . After being elected by the House , the Speaker-elect is confirmed in office by the Governor-General .
