Digital radiography is a form of X-ray imaging , where digital X-ray sensors are used instead of traditional photographic film . Advantages include time efficiency through bypassing chemical processing and the ability to digitally transfer and enhance images . Also less radiation can be used to produce an image of similar contrast to conventional radiography . Instead of X-ray film , digital radiography uses a digital image capture device . This gives advantages of immediate image preview and availability ; elimination of costly film processing steps ; a wider dynamic range , which makes it more forgiving for over- and under-exposure ; as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display of the image . # Detectors # There are two major variants of digital image capture devices : flat panel detectors ( FPDs ) and high-density line-scan solid state detectors . # Flat Panel Detectors # FPDs are further classified in two main categories : 1 . Indirect FPDs Amorphous silicon ( a-Si ) is the most common material of commercial FPDs . Combining a-Si detectors with a scintillator in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CsI ) or gadolinium oxysulfide ( Gd  2  O  2  S ) , converts X-rays to light . Because of this conversion the a-Si detector is considered an indirect imaging device . The light is channeled through the a-Si photodiode layer where it is converted to a digital output signal . The digital signal is then read out by thin film transistors ( TFTs ) or fiber-coupled CCDs . The image data file is sent to a computer for display . 2 . Direct FPDs . Amorphous selenium ( a-Se ) FPDs are known as direct detectors because X-ray photons are converted directly into charge . The outer layer of the flat panel in this design is typically a high-voltage bias electrode . X-ray photons create electron-hole pairs in a-Se , and the transit of these electrons and holes depends on the potential of the bias voltage charge . As the holes are replaced with electrons , the resultant charge pattern in the selenium layer is read out by a TFT array , active matrix array , electrometer probes or microplasma line addressing . # High-density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of a photostimulable barium fluorobromide doped with europium ( BaFBr:Eu ) or caesium bromide ( CsBr ) phosphor . The phosphor detector records the X-ray energy during exposure and is scanned by a laser diode to excite the stored energy which is released and read out by a digital image capture array of a CCD. # Radiological examinations # # Medical # Medical Uses for Digital Radiography ( DR ) can be broken into two subcategories , Dental , and the rest of the body . # # Dental # # The radiological examinations in dentistry may be classified into ' ' intraoral ' ' where the film or sensor is placed in the mouth , the purpose being to focus on a small region of the oral-maxillofacial region and ' ' extraoral ' ' where the film or sensor is placed outside the mouth aiming to visualize the entire oral maxillofacial region . Extraoral imaging is further divided into orthopantomogram , showing a section , curved following more or less mandible shape , of the whole maxillofacial block and cephalometric analysis showing a projection , as parallel as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides the clinician with the ability to store their images on a computer . This provides two key advantages over film in the form of full screen images that can be enhanced and zoomed in on , aiding diagnostics and providing easier patient communication , as well as allowing dental offices to communicate images electronically , allowing for simpler referrals and , where applicable , easier insurance claim submission . # # Rest of the Body Digital Radiography # # ( This is an expanding and changing field of science , and subject to revision ) Digital Radiography is replacement of the former Analog methods of detection , with the almost instantaneous development of images on a digital display , instead of the former methods of film and the associated delay in time and chemistry consumption . # Industrial Usage of X-Rays # # # Aerospace # # Aerospace is an industry that has experienced great growth in recent decades . Non Destructive Testing ( NDT ) in aerospace has a special driver of its own due to the high levels of human traffic involved ; the crash of a civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life reaching catastrophic proportions . Therefore , strict NDT specifications have been set to detect very small cracks and defects in engine turbo discs , blades and airframe structures , in both production and ongoing maintenance . # # Security # # Digital Radiography ( DR ) has existed in various forms ( for example , CCD and amorphous Silicon imagers ) in the security X-ray inspection field for over 20 years and is rapidly replacing the use of film for inspection X-rays in the Security and NDT fields . DR has opened a window of opportunity for the aerospace NDT industry due to several key advantages including excellent image quality , high POD , portability , environmental friendliness and immediate imaging . # Digital radiographic systems # Digital dental radiography comes in two forms : direct , that connect directly to the computer via USB and provides immediate images , and indirect ( photostimulable phosphor plates , or PSP ) which uses plates that are radiated and then digitally scanned . Direct digital sensors represent a significant initial investment , but in addition to the convenience of digital images , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends in the dental chair . They also reduce the need for the constant purchase of film and the necessary development chemicals . Early systems used CCD sensor technology , but changed to Amorphous Silicon ( aSi:H ) sensors following their introduction in early 1998-9 . Indirect digital imaging ( also termed Computed Radiography ) utilizes a reusable plate in place of the film . After X-ray exposure the plate ( sheet ) is placed in a special scanner where the latent formed image is retrieved point by point and digitized , using laser light scanning . The digitized images are stored and displayed on the computer screen . This method is halfway between old film-based technology and current direct digital imaging technology . It is similar to the film process because it involves the same image support handling but differs in that the chemical development process is replaced by scanning . This is not much faster than film processing and the resolution and sensitivity performances are contested . PSP has been described as having an advantage of fitting within any pre-existing equipment without modification because it replaces the existing film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replacement of scratched plates . # Invention # In the early 1960s , while developing compact , lightweight , portable equipment for the onboard nondestructive testing ( NDT ) of naval aircraft , Frederick G. Weighart and James F. McNulty ( 1929-2014 ) at Automation Industries , Inc. , then , in El Segundo , California co-invented the apparatus , which produced the worlds first digital radiograph , a fluoroscope image . Square wave signals were detected by the pixels of a cathode ray tube to create the image . # Historical milestones for digital intraoral sensors # * 1987 RVG ( ' ' radiovisiography ' ' ) , Trophy Radiology ( France ) introduced the world 's first intraoral X-rays imaging sensor . Trophy Radiology patented it under the restricted name ' ' radiovisiography ' ' ( other companies use the phrase ' ' digital radiography ' ' ) and continues to produce intraoral sensors today under the Carestream Dental name , which is used under license by Carestream Health . Carestream Dental has released a wireless version of their RVG intraoral sensor named the RVG 6500. * 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sundsvall , Sweden ) is introduced . The company went out of business and their technology was purchased by Dent-X , recently renamed to ImageWorks ( USA ) . First distributor in North America was Video Dental Concepts 1992 * 1993 VisualX of ' ' Gendex ' ' -Italy ( subsidiary of USA company ) . * 1994 CDR of ' ' Schick Technologies ' ' , USA . Schick were the first company to offer three film-like sizes of sensor , as well providing the significant breakthroughs of CMOS-APS technology ( 1998 ) , USB connectivity ( 1999 ) , the first sensors without cables ( 2003 ) and the first sensors with replaceable cables ( 2008 ) . They launched their second generation of CMOS-APS chips in 2009 . Schick merged with Sirona ( Germany ) in 2006 and is now part of Sirona Dental Systems , LLC. * 1995 SIDEXIS of ' ' Sirona ' ' , DEXIS of ' ' ProVison Dental Systems , Inc.
