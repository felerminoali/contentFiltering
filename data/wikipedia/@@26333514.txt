dissolved = The Moderate Party ( ) or Moderate Liberal Party ( ) was one of the two Spanish political parties that contended for power during the reign of Isabel II ( reigned 18331868 ) . Like the opposing Progressive Party ( ) , they characterized themselves as liberal and dynasticist : that is , both parties supported Isabel against the claims of the Carlists. # Trajectory # The moderates or liberal moderates were a continuation of the ' ' doceaistas ' ' , supporters of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 during the ' ' Trienio Liberal ' ' ( liberal triennium ) of 18201823 , as opposed to the more radical ' ' exaltados ' ' or ' ' veinteaistas ' ' . In the last years of the reign of Ferdinand VII they had effected a mutual drawing together with the least absolutist elements of his government . Upon the death of Ferdinand , they supported the royal claim of the king 's only child , the three-year-old Isabel , under the regency of queen mother Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies . In contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuation of the ' ' Antiguo Rgimen ' ' , under the Infante Carlos , Count of Molina . The party was organized in 1834 during the governmental presidency of Francisco Martnez de la Rosa . After several years of progressivist domination , it held power continuously during the so-called ' ' Dcada moderada ' ' ( Moderate decade , 1843-1854 ) under the leadership of General Ramn Mara Narvez ; after the ' ' bienio progresista ' ' ( progressivist biennium , 1853-1855 ) it returned to power allied with the Liberal Union ( ) . After the Glorious Revolution of 1868 and the constitution of 1869 they failed to obtain representation in the new Cortes , and lost all power . When the monarchy was restored in 1874 following the First Spanish Republic , they united with the Liberal Union to form the Liberal-Conservative Party under the direction of Antonio Cnovas del Castillo. # Ideology # The party 's political ideology of moderatism ( ) is comparable to British conservatism and , especially , to French doctrinairism , from whom its ideologues ( especially Juan Donoso Corts ) took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Strong royal power *Pure capitalism *Domestic peace *Total centralism , with all power emanating from Madrid . # Support # The Moderate Party was supported by part of the Army ( the moderate ' ' espadones ' ' such as General Narvez ) , landowners ( a landowning oligarchy of traditional aristocrats and upper bourgeoisie , especially the large landowners owners , the ' ' latifundistas ' ' of Andalusia and the Meseta Central ) , and a portion of the middle class ( the so-called ' ' gente de orden ' ' people of order ) . Economically the party tended to support free trade , allowing the export of agricultural surplus , a policy compatible with the interests of its social base . Electorally , they defended limited suffrage , in particular ' ' sufragio censitario ' ' , census suffrage that limited the electoral census to the wealthy , only those who owned a certain amount of property or paid a certain amount of taxes . Once Carlism had been defeated militarily , the 1839 Convention of Vergara that put an end to the war allowed some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support it from without . Similarly , after the Concordat of 1851 the party gained the support of much of the clergy , although the so-called ' ' neocatlicos ' ' ( neo-Catholics ) remained outside and still nurtured hopes of a Carlist restoration . # Notes # # References # *Francisco Cnovas Snchez and Jos Mara Jover Zamora , ' ' El Partido Moderado ' ' , Centro de Estudios Constitucionales , 1982 .
