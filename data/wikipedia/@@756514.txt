His half-brother Milan also took part in the Uprising , rising to become the commander/voivode ( duke ) of the Rudnik district . After the rebellion collapsed , Milo was among the few of its leaders that remained in Serbia to face the vengeful returning Ottoman Turks . After the killing of Karaore Petrovi , in 1817 , Obrenovi became the leader of the Serbs . In April 1815 , he organized and led the Second Serbian Uprising . After defeating the Turks , and Napoleons defeat in Russia Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815 . As a result of the agreement , Serbia gained some autonomy , but remained under Ottoman sovereignty . Milo Obrenovi was left in power as its absolute ruler .

Following one such rebellion , he agreed to adopt a constitution in 1835 . The move was opposed by neighboring Austria , the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia . It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government . Metternich 's Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and ministry of foreign affairs . Milo abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and Turkey . Milo abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sons Milan , who died a few weeks later , and Mihailo , who then became prince . Mihailo was deposed in 1842 , and the family was out of power until 1858 , when it returned with Milo restored as prince for the last two years of his life .
