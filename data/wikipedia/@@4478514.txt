partlength = The Armement Air-Sol Modulaire ( Air-to-Ground Modular Weapon ) ( AASM ) Hammer is a French Precision-Guided Munition developed by Sagem Dfense Scurit . AASM comprises a frontal guidance kit and a rear-mounted range extension kit matched to a dumb bomb . The weapon is modular because it can integrate different types of guidance units and different types of bombs . The basic version features a 250kg lb bomb plus hybrid inertial navigation system ( INS ) / Global Positioning System ( GPS ) guidance . Other variants add imaging infrared ( IIR ) or semi-active laser homing ( SALH ) to increase accuracy ; there are also versions with 125kglb adj=on , convert or 1000kg lb bomb bodies . It entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation , from Rafale and Mirage 2000 . It is also known as ' ' HAMMER ' ' ( Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range ) . # Development # The program started in 1997 , when the Dlgation Gnrale pour l'Armement ( DGA ) , the French defense procurement agency , launched an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 , a contract was awarded to SAGEM for an initial lot of AASM GPS/INS bomb kits , expected at the time to be delivered from 2004 and to enter service the following year . # Validation # A test campaign to validate in flight the main performances of this AASM variant started on December 6 , 2004 and ended on July 26 , 2005 . While demonstrating excellent results , this campaign showed the need to change some of the aerodynamic features of the weapon . To compensate for delays in AASM deliveries in 2008 France ordered dual-mode ( laser- and GPS/INS-guided ) GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II kits for integration with Mirage 2000D and Rafale fighter-bombers . The GPS/INS + IIR guided version completed its qualification tests on July 9 , 2008 after three firings at the DGA 's missile test range in Biscarosse . This 250 kg IR version performed a night launch from a Rafale fighter-bomber at DGA 's Biscarosse test range in December 2010 . According to Sagem , the weapon was launched at a range of more than 50 km from the target , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully test fired on January 27 , 2009 , and a laser guided variant was air-launched for the first time on June 17 , 2010. # Cost # According to French Senate 's Comit des Prix de Revient des fabrications d'Armement ( CPRA ) cited by the daily La Tribune , the total cost of the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is 846m . On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM , although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities ( 250,000 kits ) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved . The 2012 defence budget presented to the Senate reported the project had cost 592.2m ( US$800m ) with a unit cost of 164,000 , or 252,000 including development costs . # Variants # AASM comes in several variants according to its size and the type of guidance used . * The current model features a 250 kg bomb matched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing a rocket booster and enlarged fins . There is also a 125 kg , first tested in 2009 , and a proposed 1000 kg version . * As for guidance , the basic version combines data from a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receiver and an inertial navigation system ( INS ) unit through Kalman filtering , achieving a 10 m circular error probability ( CEP ) . This decametric all-weather variant is complemented by a metric day/night fair weather version which adds imaging infrared ( IIR ) guidance that matches the target area with a target model stored in its memory for a 1 m CEP. * A third version uses semi-active laser homing instead of IIR allowing it to hit moving targets with more precision . It was qualified in April 2013 . On October 2010 , these versions were given alphanumeric designations with the INS/GPS version becoming the SBU-38 ( SBU=Smart Bomb Unit ) , the INS/GPS/IIR version becoming the SBU-54 and the INS/GPS/SALH version becoming the SBU-64 ; the system as a whole was renamed Hammer to make it more appealing to export customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed by the DGA in 2000 for a total of 744 units ; deliveries started in 2007 after a two-year delay in development . In 2009 a second order for 680 units was placed , by the end of that year deliveries had reached 334. # Afghanistan # AASM made its combat debut on April 20 , 2008 , during the War in Afghanistan when a Rafale fighter fired two in support of ground troops . # Libya # On 24 March 2011 it was reported that an AASM missile fired from a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet , the first Libyan warplane to challenge the no-fly zone during the 2011 Libyan civil war , on the runway just after the plane had landed at Misrata Airport . On 6 April 2011 , it was reported that a AASM missile fired from a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan tank at a range of 55 km . In Libya , 225 AASM bombs have been fired Also referred to as the Hammer , the AASM weapon has impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit and propulsion system , the design will eventually be available for use with standard bombs weighing between 125kg and 1,000kg , although a 250kg version is the only one currently in service . Sagem cites a range capability of more than 32nm from high altitude , or 8nm from low level . Launches can also be made from an off-axis angle of up to 90 , while up to six weapons can be fired against individual targets in a single pass and with just one trigger press . And Libya represents the first opportunity for the French air force to employ the Thales Damocles targeting pod , although the Navy gave the system its combat debut over Afghanistan in late 2010. # Operators # * * # See also # * LT PGB * LS PGB * JDAM * Paveway IV * HGK ( bomb ) * Spice
