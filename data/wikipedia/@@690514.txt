deathplace = Neuilly-sur-Seine , Paris , France Ahmad Shh Qjr ( ) ( 21 January 1898 21 February 1930 ) was Shah of Persia ( today 's Iran ) from 16 July 1909 , to 31 October 1925 , and the last ruling member of the Qajar dynasty . # Reign # Ahmad Shah ascended to the Sun Throne on 16 July 1909 , following the overthrow of his father and predecessor , Mohammad Ali Shah , who had attempted to reverse earlier constitutional restrictions on royal power , and thus enraged the majority of Persians . It is alleged that Ahmad Shah was one of the most selfish kings of Persia while others regard him as a strong ruler , interested in attending to the matters of government . After removing Muhammad Ali Shah from power , the Grand Majles placed Ahmad Shah on the throne . The Grand Majles consisted of 500 delegate members who came from different backgrounds . They held a special tribunal in order to punish all those who participated in the civil war , among those hanged was Sheikh Fazlollah Noori Ahmad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by appointing the best ministers he could find . He was , however , an ineffective ruler who was faced with internal unrest and foreign intrusions , particularly by the British Empire The Second Majles convened on November 1910 and just like the First Majlis , did not lead to any relevant accomplishment . The Majles was rendered ineffective because the central government was weak and did not have enough influence to reign in the changes that it had proposed . It is alleged that the Second Majles did not get along with Ahmad Shah . In 1917 , Britain used Persia as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917 . The newly born Soviet Union responded by annexing portions of northern Persia as buffer states much like its Tsarist predecessor . Marching on Tehran , the Soviets extracted ever more humiliating concessions from the Qajar government whose ministers Ahmad Shah was often unable to control . The weakness of the central bureaucracy in the face of such aggression by an atheist foreign power sparked seething anger among many traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn both communism and monarchy as treason against Persia 's sovereignty and the laws of Islam . By 1920 , the government had virtually lost all power outside its capital and Ahmad Shah had lost control of the situation . The Anglo-Persian Agreement , along with new political parties , furthermore immobilized the country . The Moderates and Democrats often clashed , particularly when it came to minority rights and secularism . The debates between the two political parties led to violence and even assassinations . The weak economic state of Persia put Ahmad Shah and his government at the mercy of foreign influence ; they had to obtain loans from the Imperial Bank of Persia . Furthermore , under the agreement , only a small fraction of the income generated by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was received by Persia . On the other hand , the Red Army along with rebels and warlords ruled much of the countryside . On 21 February 1921 , Ahmad Shah was pushed aside in a military coup by his Minister of War and commander of the Cossack garrison , Colonel Reza Khan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup , Reza Khan used three thousand men and only eighteen machine guns , a very bloodless coup that moved forward quickly . Reza Khan was a self-made man who climbed his way up through the military ranks and appeared to be the right man to take back control of Persia . One of his first actions was to rescind the Anglo-Persian Treaty , and this was seen as a very successful diplomatic move since the treaty was very unpopular . In addition , he signed the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship . This agreement canceled all previous treaties between the two countries and also gave Persia full and equal shipping right in the Caspian Sea . Stripped of all his remaining powers , Ahmad Shah went into exile with his family in 1923 . Ahmad Shah 's apparent lack of interest in attending to the affairs of the state and poor health had prompted him to leave Persia on this extended European Tour . He was formally deposed on 31 October 1925 , when Reza Khan was proclaimed Shah by the Founders Assembly , taking the title Reza Shah Pahlavi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and established the Pahlavi Dynasty . # Exile # The coup of 1921 rendered Ahmad Shah politically weaker and less relevant . In 1923 , Ahmad Shah left Persia for Europe for health reasons . Later , the formal termination of the Qajar Dynasty by the Majles , turned Ahmad Shah 's 1923 European tour into exile . From exile , Ahmad Shah issued the following declaration indicating his displeasure with the turn of events that had led to his overthrow : Shortly after the coup , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who had just taken power in Turkey as its first president , offered to help restore Ahmad Shah to the throne . To that end , he summoned Persian Ambassador to Turkey , Anoushirvan Sepahbody to the presidential palace and instructed him to immediately intervene on his behalf with Soltan Ahmad Shah in Paris with the following offer of assistance : Ahmad Shah politely declined this offer , possibly either due to pride or lack of interest in continuing as king . Allegedly , it was only after this rejection of Ataturk 's offer that the Turkish government threw its full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing him as the new sovereign of Persia . Prior to his death , it is said that Ahmad Shah followed frequent crash diets which did not help his health . For example , he lost and gained 90 kg within a two year span . He died in 1930 at Neuilly-sur-Seine , outside Paris , France , and was buried in his family crypt in Kerbela , Iraq . His brother , former crown prince Mohammad Hassan Mirza , assured the physical continuation of the dynasty through his descendants . # Offspring # Ahmad Shah Qajar married five times .
