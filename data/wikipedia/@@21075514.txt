It is the third and final volume in The Colossus Trilogy and a sequel to Jones 's 1974 novel ' ' The Fall of Colossus ' ' . # Plot summary # The novel begins where its predecessor , ' ' The Fall of Colossus ' ' leaves off , with the supercomputer immobilized and the Martians arriving on Earth . They appear before Charles Forbin and his friend Edward Blake in the form of two black spheres , and quickly demonstrate vast intellect and powers of transformation and telepathy . After immobilizing Blake , they explain to Forbin their purpose in immobilizing Colossus their desire to take half of the Earth 's oxygen , a process that will kill nearly a quarter of the human population . In order to proceed with construction of the Collector designed to harvest the oxygen , the Martians reactivate the parts of Colossus necessary to manage human society . Though having no other option but to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an alternative . He discovers in conversation with the Martians that their need for the oxygen is driven by the threat of radiation emanating from the Crab Nebula , which will kill the Martians without the protection of an oxygenated atmosphere . As construction of the Collector proceeds , a humbled Blake proposes to Forbin that the old Colossus the parent of the crippled system , be reactivated . With little other alternative , Forbin agrees . Construction equipment controlled by Colossus soon completes work on the Collector . An initial five-minute test of the device proves enormously destructive . With a second , final test imminent , Blake travels to Colorado with Angela , Forbin 's private secretary . Racing against time , Blake and a small team of workers succeeds in penetrating the mountain where the old Colossus is located and re-activating the computer , only to discover that , once imputed with the facts of the situation , Colossus argues that the collection program is in the best interests of humans ' long-term future and should move forward . Informed of the failure of their plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he embarks on a new plan . With his new secretary , a fervently devout woman named Joan , he flies to Portsmouth and takes command of the battleships stationed there for the Sea War Games . Yet doing so puts him out of contact with Blake and the old Colossus , who informs Blake that a solution might exist that is acceptable to both the Martians and humanity . Regaining control of the nuclear arsenal , Colossus contacts the Martians , who inform it of Forbin 's attempt to use the battleships to destroy the Collector . Though the Martians attempt to destroy the fleet using their device , they underestimate the power of the battleships ' guns , which succeed in destroying the Collector . Though the Martians are defeated Forbin dies in the process . He is buried by the reactivated Colossus , who reaches an agreement with the Martians . A smaller version of the Collector will extract the oxygen more gradually and sustainably ; in return , humanity , with the guidance of Colossus , will retreat to Mars once the Sun has become a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Professor Charles Forbin The Director of Staff for Colossus and his chief human representative . * Doctor Edward Blake The Director of Input for Colossus and a leader of the Fellowship . * Angela Forbin 's secretary , who harbors a secret love for her boss . * Joan Angela 's assistant , a member of the Sect , the organization that worships Colossus as God . * The Martians Two ancient beings of enormous intellect and power .
