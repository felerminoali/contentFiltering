The House of Laval is a family of barons , later counts , coming from the town of Laval , located in Northwestern France , part of the province of Maine before the French Revolution . The Laval were one of the most powerful families of Maine during the Middle Ages and also had a presence in Brittany , where their prestige was similar to the one of the Rohan . The House of Laval played a significant role in Breton history and during the Hundred Years War and the French Wars of Religion . They also favored the French Renaissance in Northwestern France , building several chteaux . The last male heir died during the 17th century , and his possessions went to the House of La Trmoille . Franois de Laval was the first Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec ; the city of Laval , Quebec , and the Universit Laval were named after him . # Branches and titles # The House of Laval appeared during the first quarter of the 11th century .
