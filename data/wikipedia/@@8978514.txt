Dentistry throughout the world is practised differently , and training in dentistry varies as well . # Australia # Australian dentistry is overseen by the Australian Dental Council and the Dental Board of Australia The professional body for dentists is the Australian Dental Association . Dentists trained in Australia must meet the entry requirements of one of the Australian institutions offering dental courses , and then complete the required full-time academic training leading to a dental degree . If dentists wish to specialize , they must complete extra study after having had clinical experience . In order to practice dentistry in Australia ( as of July 2010 ) you must obtain registration and licensing from the nationalized Dental Board of Australia . Generally , the only persons immediately entitled to apply to be registered as dentists are persons holding the qualifications of DDS , BDS , BDSc , BDent , BDentSc , DMD , MDent , or GradDipDent from an accredited Australian and New Zealand university . Usually registration will not be granted to a foreign graduate until he or she has passed the ADC examinations and/or completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally accredited dental qualification The Universities of Queensland , Adelaide , Western Australia , Griffith , James Cook , Central Sturt and LaTrobe all offer undergraduate dental degree courses of 5 years in length . Sydney University offers a graduate entry program which is 4-years duration and requires a previous bachelors degree for admission . Melbourne University also has a 4-year graduate entry dental program starting in 2011 . The qualifications awarded by these schools satisfy the formal academic requirements for registration . Admissions to an undergraduate dental school in Australia is often known as the most difficult admissions among other countries . Only 1% of all qualified applicants yearly pass the Australia 's dental school admissions and get entry into dentistry programs . Australian dental schools include but are not limited to : *University of Adelaide *University of Melbourne *University of Queensland *University of Sydney *University of Western Australia *Latrobe University *Griffith University *James Cook University *Charles Sturt University # Brazil # To become a dentist in Brazil , one must complete a test with 100 questions and compete against other candidates .

The practice of dentistry in Brazil is overseen by CFO ' ' Conselho Federal de Odontologia ' ' , a federal entity that coordinates the 27 State bodies . This institution has 340,000 registered dentists and 191 universities and/or colleges in Brazil .

The dentists in the MERCOSUL are eligible to Work in Argentina , Chile , Paraguay , Uruguay and Peru . # Canada # The practice of dentistry in Canada is overseen by the National Dental Association Examination Board of Canada ( NDAEB ) , while specialization is overseen by the Royal College of Dentists . Today , Canada has about 16,000 dentists . Canadian dentistry is not publicly run ( see Medicare ( Canada ) ) ; however , some provinces provide for free dental care for children and the elderly . Other Canadians are mostly covered by workplace dental plans , but many have to pay out-of-pocket . For most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada . In severe situations , barbers or blacksmiths would pull a tooth , but for many years Canada lagged behind European advances . The first dentists in Canada were United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution . The first recorded dentist in Canada was a Mr. Hume who advertised in a Halifax newspaper in 1814 . During the first half of the 19th century , dentistry expanded rapidly . In 1867 the Ontario Dental Association was formed and in 1868 they founded Canada 's first dental school in Toronto , the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario . The University of Toronto agreed to be affiliated with the dental school . As time passed , other Canadian universities also created dentistry programmes . However , the University of Toronto still has the largest dental school in Canada that features the most postgraduate research opportunities as well as certifications for all the dental specialties . The UBC Faculty of Dentistry supports five specialty programs being Prosthodontics , Endodontics , Orthodontics , Pedodontics and Periodontics . Dental care is not covered by the Canadian health care system , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ; Canadian dental schools *University of Toronto ( 1868 ) *McGill University ( 1905 ) *Universit de Montral ( 1905 ) *Dalhousie University ( 1908 ) *University of Alberta ( 1923 ) *University of Manitoba ( 1958 ) *University of British Columbia ( 1964 ) *University of Western Ontario ( 1966 ) *University of Saskatchewan ( 1968 ) *Universit Laval ( 1971 ) # Chile # In Chile dentists require six years of post secondary education which , after 2 years dedicated to fundamental scientific and medical knowledge ( chemistry , physics , biology , morphology , anatomy , histology etc. ) puts a particular emphasis on practice and the accountability to patients in the last 4 years . Specialization programms of 3 - 4 years ( admission by competition ) are possible after a minimum of 3 years ' working experience has been completed . The first dental school was established at the Universidad de Chile in the year 1888 . Other institutions providing professional dental education in Chile are Universidad Austral de Chile since 2004 , Universidad de Concepcin since 1919 , Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universidad de la Frontera ( since 1992 ) , Universidad de Talca , which are public universities , and the following private universities:Universidad Nacional Andrs Bello , Universidad Mayor , Universidad de los Andes , Universidad Diego Portales , Universidad del Desarrollo , Universidad San Sebastin and Universidad de Antofagasta . After having been influenced for decades by both the European ( especially from German-speaking countries ) and North American dentistry , Chilean education and practice in dentistry has now reached a self-sufficient level and benefits from a range of top-level institutes , professors and practitioners . Research has developed at a fast pace and many articles find their path to international publications . # Costa Rica # Dentistry is overseen by the Colegio de Cirujanos Dentistas de Costa Rica . Dentists complete 6 year courses from the University of Costa Rica in D.D.S. ( Doctor of Dental Surgery ) , or similar courses from various private universities .

With exception of rural Alaska , Dental therapists are not permitted to practice in the United States . Use of dental therapists , dental health aids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strongly opposed by the American Dental Association , ( the A.D.A. ) , the dentists ' professional association . This has resulted in excellent but high-priced treatment which , however , fails to delivers services at a reasonable price to the lower social classes . With only a few exceptions , neither government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare nor Medicaid cover routine dental treatment . As a result large sections of the population do without . The worst conditions are in Kentucky and West Virginia . Rates for dental services have been rising rapidly , out pacing the rate of inflation . After falling for many years , the percentage of both adults and children with unfilled cavities began to rise in 2000 as did the percentage of adults with no teeth . Increasingly , people with adequate income to pay the fees are forgoing treatment . # Dental therapists # Outside the United States , more than 50 countries allow technicians called dental therapists to drill and fill cavities , usually in children . In the U.S. , most state boards of dentistry have blocked dental therapists from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill teeth , because it is an irreversible surgical procedure and can lead to serious complications like infections or nerve damage . The University of Minnesota is the first University in the United States to start a dental therapy program . # Dental education in the United States # There are limited opportunities for dental education in the United States with only 4,440 graduating in 2003 , down from 5,750 in 1982 .

In the United States , dentists earn either a D.D.S. ( Doctor of Dental Surgery ) or D.M.D. ( Doctor of Dental Medicine ) degree . There is no difference in the training for either degree . The degrees are equivalent , and recognized equally by all state boards of dentistry . There are 56 accredited dental schools in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one unique 3 year program at the University of the Pacific ) . Most applicants to dental school have attained at least a B.S. or B.A. degree , however , a small percentage are admitted after only fulfilling specific prerequisite courses . So unlike many other countries ( other than US , Canada , and Australia ) , it usually takes more than 8 years to become a dentist . ( List of dental schools in the United States ) The difference relates to the history involved in the division of medicine and surgery in medical practice . Licensure is organized on three levels in most areas . Many dentists must pass National Boards , Regional Boards , and then take a jurisprudence exam accepted by their state to fulfill their requirements to get a state license . Not all states require or even accept regional boards . Although a state license is only valid in the issuing state , because of the regional boards a dentist may be able to apply for licensure in any other state within the jurisdiction of their regional board . There are many cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license so as to procure a license either via licensure by credentials or licensure by reciprocity . Although a national licensure exam has yet to be made , the American Dental Association ( ADA ) has worked with education and examining groups to form such an exam . A dentist may go on for further training in a dental specialty which require an additional 1 to 7 years of post-doctoral training . There are 9 recognized dental specialties . These include Endodontics ( root canal treatment ) , Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology , Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics ( gums ) , Prosthodontics ( complicated dental reconstruction ) , Orthodontics ( moving teeth ) , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery ( surgery of the mouth and face ) , and Dental Public Health . There is no specialty in esthetic dentistry or implantology , and no additional training is required for a dentist to make the claim of being an esthetic or cosmetic dentist .
