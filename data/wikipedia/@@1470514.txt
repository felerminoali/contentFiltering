Operation Soap was a raid by the Metropolitan Toronto Police against four gay bathhouses in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , which took place on February 5 , 1981 . More than three hundred men were arrested , the largest mass arrest in Canada since the 1970 October crisis , before the record was broken during the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Edmonton , Alberta . The event marked a major turning point in the history of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community in Canada ; the raids and their aftermath are today widely considered to be the Canadian equivalent of the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City . Mass protests and rallies were held denouncing the incident . These evolved into Toronto 's current Pride Week , which is now one of the world 's largest gay pride festivals and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2010 . Several Toronto bathhouses had previously been raided , and other raids followed . Most charges connected to the incident were eventually dropped or discharged , although some bathhouse owners were fined . Canada 's bawdy-house law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has never been repealed , but has only rarely been applied against gay establishments since the trials connected to the 1981 raids ended . At the time it was widely believed that the raids were approved by Attorney General of Ontario Roy McMurtry and the provincial government . In a 2007 interview , however , McMurtry said that this was not the case : The irony of the whole thing was that I had expressed my concern to the chief of police ; that it really looked like we were dissolving into a police state . The whole thing looked terrible . Without a doubt , that was one of my most frustrating experiences . McMurtry subsequently served as Chief Justice of Ontario and wrote the 2003 decision of Ontario 's Court of Appeal in favour of same-sex marriage . # Timeline # # 1981 # * February 5 : At 11 p.m. , more than 150 police simultaneously raid the Club Baths , the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa , the Richmond Street Health Emporium and the Barracks in Toronto .
