Goscelin of Saint-Bertin ( or Goscelin of Canterbury ) was a Benedictine hagiographical writer . His date of birth is unknown , but it can not have been later than the early 1040s . He was a Fleming or Brabantian by birth and became a monk of St Bertin 's at Saint-Omer before travelling to England to take up a position in the household of Herman , Bishop of Ramsbury ( 1058-78 ) . During his time in England , he stayed at many monasteries and wherever he went collected materials for his numerous hagiographies of English saints . # Life # # Flanders # According to William of Malmesbury , Goscelin was a monk of St Bertin 's . On the other hand , as the author of the ' ' Vita Amalbergae virginis ' ' , written before 1062 , Goscelin appears to be very well informed about the hagiographic tradition in Flanders and Brabant , more especially traditions related to Saint Peter 's Abbey of Ghent . He probably stayed there at some time before 1062. # England # According to William of Malmesbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who arrived in 1058 . But , William of Malmesbury mistakenly claims that this was the year in which Herman became bishop of Sherborne , an appointment he did not take up until the death of Sherborne 's resident bishop AElfwold in 1062-65 . It is doubtful , therefore , that his information about Goscelin 's arrival is reliable . In fact , Goscelin states , himself , in his ' ' Liber confortatorius ' ' , that ' he first came to the bishop ' at Potterne or Canning ( in Wiltshire ) , implying that he did not travel to England in his company , but joined him there instead . It used to be thought that he arrived before the Norman Conquest , but there is no evidence for this supposition , although it is possible . Goscelin 's patron and companion was Herman , Bishop of Sherborne . He functioned as secretary to the bishop and as chaplain to the nuns of Wilton Abbey . His fortunes took a turn for the worse when Bishop Herman died in 1078 and was succeeded by Osmund of Ses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' describes as a king who knew not Joseph . In the early 1080s , he was at Peterborough . Later , he wrote hagiography for the monastic communities of Ely , Barking , Ramsey , and St Augustine 's , Canterbury , among other places . # Writing # William of Malmesbury praises his industry in the highest terms . He was at Ely about 1082 , where he wrote a life of St thelthryth . Between 1087 and 1091 he was at Ramsey , and compiled there a life of the abbot St Ivo , or Ives . In the 1090s , he went to Canterbury , where he wrote his account of the translation of the relics of St Augustine and his companions , which had taken place in 1091 . He wrote it in the octave year after that event , i.e. in 1098-99 , and dedicated the work to St Anselm . A Canterbury obituary , quoted by Henry Wharton in ' ' Anglia Sacra ' ' , gives 15 May as the day of death of a certain Goscelin , who may have been this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still alive in 1106 , when he wrote an account of the translation of St Wihtburh , of Ely His works consist of the lives of many English saints , chiefly of those connected with Canterbury , where he spent his last years . Some of them have been printed by the Bollandists , by Jean Mabillon , and by Jacques-Paul Migne . Others are contained in manuscripts in the British Museum and at Cambridge . His chief work was a life of St Augustine of Canterbury , professing to be based on older records and divided into two parts , -- an Historia major ( Mabillon , ' ' Acta Sactorum ' ' . O.S.B. , I ) and an Historia minor ( in Wharton , ' ' Anglia Sacra ' ' , I ) . His method seems to have been usually to take some older writer as his basis and to reproduce his work , in his own style .

According to William of Malmesbury , Goscelin was also a skilled musician . # Works # # Flanders ( St. Peter 's Abbey , Ghent ) # *Between 1055-1062 : Vita S. Amalbergae virginis ( ed . J.B.
