Cruciate ligaments ( also cruciform ligaments ) are pairs of ligaments arranged like a letter X. * In the fingers , the deep and superficial flexor tendons pass through a fibro-osseous tunnel system the flexor mechanism of annular and cruciate ligaments called pulleys . The cruciate pulleys tether the long flexor tendons . The number and extent of these cruciate and annular ligaments varies among individuals , but three cruciate and four or five annular ligaments are normally found in each finger ( usually referred to as , for example , A1 pulley and C1 pulley ) . The thumb has a similar system for its long flexor tendon but with a single oblique pulley replacing the cruciate pulleys found in the fingers . * The human foot has a cruciate crural ligament , also known as inferior extensor retinaculum of foot . The equine foot has a pair of cruciate distal sesamoidean ligaments in the metacarpophalangeal joint . These ligaments can be seen using computed tomography . # Clinical significance # # Rupture # Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is one of the most frequent acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cats ; direct trauma to the joint is relatively uncommon and age appears to be a major factor . Cruciate ligament injuries are common in animals , and in 2005 a study estimated that $1.32 billion was spent in the United States in treating the cranial cruciate ligament of dogs . # History # # Etymology # In the first edition of the official Latin nomenclature ( ' ' Nomina Anatomica ' ' , rebaptized in 1998 as ' ' Terminologia Anatomica ' ' ) , the Latin expression ' ' ligamenta cruciata ' ' was used , similar to the expression ' ' cruciate ligaments ' ' currently in use in English . The nomenclature committee of the ' ' Basle Nomenclature Anatomica ' ' intended to use the past participle ' ' cruciata ' ' , derived from the verb ' ' cruciare ' ' , to refer to ' ' crossed ' ' . In classical Latin the verb ' ' cruciare ' ' is derived from ' ' crux ' ' , with the latter noun meaning ' ' cross ' ' . Reference works from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ' ' cruciate ' ' equivalent to ' ' cross-shaped ' ' . In classical Latin , ' ' cruciare ' ' however means ' ' to torture ' ' and ' ' to torment ' ' and not ' ' to cross ' ' . Early Christian writers , like Lactantius , used ' ' cruciare ' ' in the sense of ' ' to crucify ' ' . English ' ' cruciate ' ' , derived from Latin ' ' cruciatus ' ' , used to refer similarly to ' ' tortured ' ' and ' ' tormented ' ' . The English translation of the list of Latin names of the ' ' Basle Nomina Anatomica ' ' partially circumvented this problem by using ' ' crucial ligaments ' ' instead of ' ' cruciate ligaments ' ' , as ' ' crucialis ' ' is absent in the classical Latin vocabulary , with ' ' crucial ' ' in English meaning ' ' crosswise ' ' or ' ' in the form of a cross ' ' . The second edition of ' ' Nomina Anatomica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus ' ' , and mentioned explicitly that the former adjective ' ' cruciata ' ' could refer to ' ' crucified ' ' . The classical Latin verb ' ' decussare ' ' means ' ' to divide crosswise , in the form of an X ' ' with its ' English ' equivalent ' ' to decussate ' ' . ) is written as X. was also used to refer to this specific numerical designation ' ' X ' ' . The Latin verb ' ' decussare ' ' is derived from this specific noun ' ' decussis ' ' . Earlier it was suggested to replace the adjective ' ' cruciatus ' ' by the adjective ' ' chiastus ' ' , which is a Latinization of Ancient Greek , The Greek is the upper-case of the letter chi , with a similar shape to the Latin X , denoting ten . In modern Greek a cruciate ligament is similarly called , with meaning ' ' ligament ' ' . The subsequent edition of the ' ' Nomina Anatomica ' ' , approved in 1955 , reverted back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' . Subsequent editions still used this incorrect form , despite criticism .
