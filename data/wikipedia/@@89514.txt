Infobox settlement New London is a seaport city and a port of entry on the northeast coast of the United States . It is located at the mouth of the Thames River in New London County , southeastern Connecticut . New London is located about 107 mi from Boston , Massachusetts , 56 mi from Providence , Rhode Island , 85 mi from New Bedford , Massachusetts , and about 128 mi from New York City . For several decades beginning in the early 19th century , New London was the world 's third busiest whaling port after New Bedford , Massachusetts , and Nantucket . The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city 's present architecture . New London subsequently became home to other shipping and manufacturing industries , but has gradually lost its commercial and industrial heart . The city is home to Connecticut College , Mitchell College , the United States Coast Guard Academy , and The Williams School . New London Harbor is home port to the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter ' ' ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' . New London had a population of 27,620 at the 2010 census . The Norwich-New London metropolitan area ( NECTA ) includes twenty-one towns and 274,055 people . # History # The area was called Nameaug by the Pequot Indians . John Winthrop , Jr . founded the first English settlement here in 1646 , making it about the 13th town settled in Connecticut . Inhabitants informally named it Pequot after the tribe . The Connecticut General Assembly wanted to name the town Faire Harbour , but the citizens protested , declaring that they would prefer it to be called Nameaug . The legislature relented , and on March 10 , 1658 the town was officially named after London , England . The harbor was considered to be the best deep water harbor on Long Island Sound , and consequently New London became a base of American naval operations during the Revolutionary War . Famous New Londoners during the American Revolution include Nathan Hale , William Coit , Richard Douglass , Thomas &amp; Nathaniel Shaw , Gen. Samuel Parsons , printer Timothy Green , Reverend Seabury . New London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 1781 in the Battle of Groton Heights , by Norwich native Benedict Arnold in an attempt to destroy the Revolutionary privateer fleet and supplies of goods and naval stores within the city . It is often noted that this raid on New London and Groton was to divert General Washington and the French Army under Rochambeau from their march on Yorktown , Virginia . The main defensive fort for New London , Fort Griswold , located across the Thames River in Groton , was well known to Arnold , who sold its secrets to the British fleet so they could avoid its artillery fire . After overrunning New London 's Fort Trumbull , Ft . Griswold was attacked by the British , who suffered great casualties before eventually storming the fort and slaughtering many of the militia who defended the fort . All told more than 52 British soldiers and 83 militia were killed and more than 142 British and 39 militia were wounded , many mortally . New London suffered over 6 militia killed and 24 wounded while Arnold and the British and Hessian raiding party suffered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Douglass House on Green Street Image:Park next to The Day newspaper IMG1029.JPGSmall park next to ' ' New London Day ' ' newspaper File:Citizen 's Bank in New London , CT.JPGCitizen 's Bank in New London File:Another view of downtown New London , CT.JPGAnother view of downtown New London Image : NewLondonCT StateSt 1920. jpgState Street ( ca. 1920 )  Connecticut 's independent legislature , in its January session of 1784 , made New London one of the first two cities ( along with New Haven ) brought from ' ' de facto ' ' to formalized incorporations . For several decades beginning in the early 19th century , New London was the second busiest whaling port after New Bedford , Massachusetts in the world . The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city 's present architecture . The New Haven and New London Railroad connected New London by rail to New Haven and points beyond by the 1850s . The Springfield and New London Railroad connected New London to Springfield , Massachusetts by the 1870s . Several military installations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been part of New London 's history . Most of these have been located at Fort Trumbull . The first Fort Trumbull was an earthwork built 1775-1777 that took part in the Revolutionary War . The second Fort Trumbull was built 1839-1852 and still stands . By 1910 the fort 's defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the Endicott Program , primarily located on Fishers Island . The fort was turned over to the Revenue Cutter Service and became the Revenue Cutter Academy . The Revenue Cutter Service was merged into the United States Coast Guard in 1915 , and the Academy relocated to its current site in 1932 . During World War II the Merchant Marine Officers Training School was located at Fort Trumbull . From 1950 to 1990 Fort Trumbull was the location for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory , which developed sonar and related systems for US Navy submarines . In 1990 the Sound Laboratory was merged with the Naval Underwater Systems Center in Newport , Rhode Island , and in 1996 the New London facility was closed . Although the Naval Submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stationed in New London from 1951 to 1991 . The submarine tender ' ' Fulton ' ' and Submarine Squadron Ten were at State Pier during this time . Squadron Ten was usually composed of ten submarines and was the first all-nuclear submarine squadron . In the 1990s State Pier was rebuilt as a container terminal . The family of Nobel laureate and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Eugene O'Neill ( 1888-1953 ) , and most of his own first 26 years , were intimately connected to New London . He lived for years there , and as an adult was employed and wrote his first seven or eight plays in the city . A major O'Neill archive is located at Connecticut College , and a family home there is a museum and registered national historic landmark operated by the ' ' Eugene O'Neill Theater Center ' ' . Dutch 's Tavern on Green Street was a favorite watering hole of Eugene O'Neill and still stands today . # Towns created from New London # When established , New London originally had a larger land area .

Of the whole 10.76 sqmi , nearly half is water ; 5.54 sqmi is land . The town and city of New London are coextensive . Between 1705 and 1801 sections of the original town were ceded to form newer towns . The towns of Groton , Ledyard , Montville , and Waterford ; and portions of Salem and East Lyme ; now occupy what had earlier been the outlying area of New London . New London is bounded on the west and north by the town of Waterford , on the east by the Thames River and Groton , and on the south by Long Island Sound .

New London enjoys a sunny climate , averaging 2600 hours of sunshine annually . New London is the mildest large city in Connecticut in winter . In the summer months the southerly flow from subtropical high pressure ( the Atlantic/Bermuda High ) often creates hot and humid weather . Daytime heating produces occasional thunderstorms with heavy , but brief downpours . Spring and Fall is mild in New London - with daytime highs in the 55 to 70 F range and lows in the 40 to 50 F range . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to areas inland . The first frost in the New London area is normally not until early November - almost three weeks later than parts of northern Connecticut . Winters are cool to cold with a mix of rainfall and snowfall , or mixed precipitation . New London normally sees less than 25 days annually with snow cover . In mid-winter , the differences in low temperatures between areas along the coastline and areas well inland can be large at times - often as much as 15 F. Although infrequent , tropical cyclones ( hurricanes/tropical storms ) have struck Connecticut and the New London metropolitan area . Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903 , 1938 , 1944 , 1954 ( Carol ) , 1960 ( Donna ) , 1985 ( Gloria ) . Tropical Storm Irene ( 2011 ) also caused moderate damage along the Connecticut coast , as did Hurricane Sandy ( which made landfall in New Jersey ) in 2012 . Coastal Connecticut ( including New London ) is the broad transition zone where so-called subtropical indicator plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with freeze - about the same as Baltimore , Maryland . As such , Southern Magnolias , Needle Palms , Windmill palm , Loblolly Pines , and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens .
