A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleaning properties in dilute solutions . These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates , a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water , because the polar sulfonate ( of detergents ) is less likely than the polar carboxyl ( of soap ) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water . In most household contexts , the term ' ' detergent ' ' by itself refers specifically to ' ' laundry detergent ' ' or ' ' dish detergent ' ' , as opposed to ' ' hand soap ' ' or other types of cleaning agents . Detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions . Detergents , like soaps , work because they are amphiphilic : partly hydrophilic ( polar ) and partly hydrophobic ( non-polar ) . Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds ( like oil and grease ) with water . Because air is not hydrophilic , detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees . # Chemical classification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants. # Anionic detergents # Typical anionic detergents are alkylbenzenesulfonates . The alkylbenzene portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic . Two different varieties have been popularized , those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups . The former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable . An estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets . Bile acids , such as deoxycholic acid ( DOC ) , are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils . # Cationic detergents # Cationic detergents are similar to the anionic ones , with a hydrophobic component , but , instead of the anionic sulfonate group , the cationic surfactants have quaternary ammonium as the polar end . The ammonium center is positively charged . # Non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents # Non-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged , hydrophilic headgroups . Typical non-ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glycoside . Common examples of the former include Tween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also known as ethoxylates or PEGylates and their metabolites , nonylphenol . Glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup . Examples include octyl thioglucoside and maltosides . HEGA and MEGA series detergents are similar , possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup . Zwitterionic detergents possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of +1 and 1 charged chemical groups . Examples include CHAPS . See surfactants for more applications . # Major applications of detergents # # Laundry detergents # One of the largest applications of detergents is for washing clothes . The formulations are complex , reflecting the diverse demands of the application and the highly competitive consumer market . In general , laundry detergents contain water softeners , surfactants , bleach , enzymes , brighteners , fragrances , and many other agents . The formulation is strongly affected by the temperature of the cleaning water and varies from country to country . # Fuel additives # Both carburetors and fuel injector components of Otto engines benefit from detergents in the fuels to prevent fouling .

Advancements in the purity and sophistication of detergents have facilitated structural and biophysical characterization of important membrane proteins such as ion channels , transporters , signaling receptors , and photosystem II . # Soapless soap # Soapless soap refers to a soapfree liquid cleanser with a slightly acidic pH . Soapless soaps are used in an array of products .
