Bloodstrike is a fictional team of action/adventure super agents , originally published by Rob Liefeld 's Extreme Studios of Image Comics in the 1990s . Bloodstrike was a top-secret , super-powered assassination squad deployed covertly by the United States government . All of the members had already died before becoming members of the team ; they were brought back to life by the government 's Project : Born Again . # Publication history # ' ' Bloodstrike ' ' #1 was cover dated April 1993 and the series ran for 22 issues . There was a special issue 25 printed ( after issue 10 ) as part of the Images of Tomorrow event that ran through several titles being published by Image at the time . During issue 25 , the Bloodstrike title changed dramatically as Bloodstrike became the name of a solo agent . Fans wondered how the book got from point A to point B , but issues 23 and 24 do not exist . It was later revealed that Cabbot Stone was the masked individual named Bloodstrike . After the ' ' Bloodstrike ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assassin ' ' ran for three issues ( plus an issue #0 ) featuring art by Karl Altstaetter . The character of Bloodstrike returned once again in ' ' Cabbot : Bloodhunter ' ' . Only the first issue was printed , though parts 2 and 3 were printed as backup stories in the pages of ' ' Supreme ' ' . After an 18 year hiatus , Bloodstrike issue 26 was released in March 2012 .
