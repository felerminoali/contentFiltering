Below is a list and summary of the former state highways . # State Route 62 # State Route 62 was a state highway in northwestern Arizona running a total of 4 mi from US 93 , north of Kingman to the mining town of Chloride . The road first appeared on a 1936 map and it was deleted from the state highway system in 1972 because of the closure of the mine in Chloride . The road is still in use today as a county route . # State Route 63 # State Route 63 was a state highway in northeastern Arizona . The route first appeared on a state map in 1932 running through the Petrified Forest National Park east of Winslow between then U.S. Route 66 and U.S. Route 260 . The road was decertified in 1933 and is now maintained by the National Park Service . SR 63 then appeared again on a state map in 1961 along a route from U.S. Route 66 in Sanders north to then State Route 164 . The route disappeared on maps in the early 1980s when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 160. route= previousroute=62 nextroute=64 previoustype=SR nexttype=US # State Route 65 # State Route 65 was a state highway in northern Arizona traveling in a north-south direction between Payson and Winslow . This road is now part of State Route 87 . It changed route numbers in 1967 , when the last section of paving was completed to link it with State Route 87. # State Route T-69 # This was the link between the eastern end of Interstate 10 where the Maricopa Freeway ended at 40th Street , and Arizona routes 87 and 93 near Mesa and Chandler . When the Maricopa Freeway was built and opened in 1962 , it ended at 40th Street . The Arizona Highway Department apparently wanted to post a truck route around Tempe and Mesa . SR T-69 was signed through the farm fields on 40th Street south to Baseline Road , and then east on Baseline to Country Club Drive in Mesa ( Arizona Avenue in Chandler ) , where it linked with routes 87 and 93 . For a few months in about 1970 , T-69 was the northern terminus for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ( 6 km ) of freeway were built south from Baseline to Williams Field Road ( now Chandler Blvd . ) . T-69 was not marked as Temporary I-10 , nor was it marked with TO 10 signs . Interstate 10 in the 1960s simply was not marked between Phoenix and Picacho , and remained unsigned until the interstate was opened from Baseline Road in Guadalupe to Picacho in about 1970 . T-69 west of Guadalupe remained a state highway for a few more months , until the Broadway Curve section of Interstate 10 opened ; during this period it was co-signed as the route TO 10 . T-69 was erased when the Phoenix-Tucson freeway was opened . Arizona Highway Department maps of the era referred to the route as TEMP 69 , although State Route 69 never extended south or east beyond the southern end of the Black Canyon Freeway , and T-69 never linked to Route 69. # State Route 81 # State Route 81 was a state highway in eastern Arizona that served Lyman Lake State Park from 19632005 , traversing 1.65 mi from its start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Springerville to Lyman Lake . The Arizona Department of Transportation turned the road over to the Arizona State Parks Department in 2005 as it was contained within a state park . SR 81 was the shortest state highway in Arizona before State Route 280 was established in 1976 . SR 81 , while short , served as one of the original state routes from 1927 . The route was originally a major highway stretching from Douglas to Safford . In 1936 it took over the old stretch of State Route 71 north to Sanders , but this entire route became part of U.S. Route 666 in 1938 , and subsequently renumbered to U.S. Route 191 in 1992. route= previousroute=80 nextroute=82 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 84A # State Route 84A or what is known today as West Miracle Mile in Tucson , Arizona , was designated a state route for a decade in the mid-1950s to mid-1960s to connect State Route 84 to U.S. Route 80 and 89 . This alternative route was used as an in-town route to connect the future freeway to downtown Tucson . When Interstate 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the designation of Temporary I-10 . After I-10 was built , this route was dropped from the state highway list and turned over to the City of Tucson . It is currently used by a different state route , SR 77. # State Route 89L # State Route 89L was a state highway in Page , Arizona . Though the number indicated that it was a loop for State Route 89 , that is incorrect . It was in fact a business loop for U.S. Route 89 through the town of Page , Arizona . It did not intersect SR 89 . Moreover , it was the only Arizona state highway known to have used the L suffix . SR 89L was removed from the state highway system in 2005. route= previousroute=89A nextroute=90 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 93 # State Route 93 was a state highway in Arizona that existed from 1946 to 1985 . The route was cosigned with other highways along nearly all of its route from Kingman to the border at Nogales . State Route 93 was the original designation for the highway from Kingman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point prior to 1964 the northern terminus of the state route was moved south to the unnamed desert junction with U.S. 89 just north of Wickenburg , and the southern terminus of U.S. 93 was moved route south to the U.S. 89 junction . At that junction a driver would pass from U.S. 93 onto State Route 93 . When U.S. 89 was reduced to state highway status in the 1990s , U.S. 93 's southern terminus was moved south a few miles to U.S. 60 in Wickenburg . For some unknown reason , the Arizona Highway Department either never sought , or was never granted , U.S. Highway status for Route 93 across the rest of the state . At its original northern terminus in Kingman , Arizona 93 branched off of U.S. 66 ( Andy Devine Avenue ) at Louise Avenue , which is several miles east of where U.S. Route 93 and U.S. Route 466 branched northwest to Boulder City and Las Vegas . The old two-lane State Route 93 headed east , south of and parallel to the new alignment of Interstate 40 until it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new freeway at DW Ranch Rd . ( I-40 exit 59 ) . The old road turnoff from the current U.S. 93 alignment is still apparent 4.9 mi south of the I-40/93 interchange . From Wickenburg to the southeast , State Route 93 was co-signed with U.S. Route 60 , U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 89 to Phoenix , via Grand Avenue . At Grand Avenue 's terminus at Van Buren and Seventh avenues ( Five Points ) , the quartet of highways picked up U.S. Route 80 from San Diego . The 93 emblem was at the bottom of the routes 60-70-80-89-93 totem pole for years ( along with Business Loop 10 in the 1970s and ' 80s ) for a short time ending in 1965 ) through Phoenix on Van Buren Street . The co-signing continued through Tempe on Mill Avenue and Apache Trail , and Mesa 's Main Street ( but without B-10 , which went south from Phoenix on 48th Street to join the freeway at Broadway Road . ) . At downtown Mesa 's Country Club Drive , State Route 93 made a south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles ( 8 km ) south of Chandler , State Route 87 forked off to the southeast and State Route 93 had its own unshared road south about 30 mi to Casa Grande . The middle section of this road was abandoned when it was overlapped by the adjacent Interstate 10 freeway in 1970 . The old road continues a bit south of I-10 's Casa Blanca Road interchange as a Gila Indian route , but dead ends at a new canal . The rest of the road to its former junction near the Interstate 10 interchange with State Route 587 is abandoned . You can see the old road from images on Google Earth or other satellite images . When State Route 93 was delisted , the road to Chandler from the south became State Route 587 to connect State Route 87 south of Chandler with Interstate 10 at Casa Blanca Road . The southern stub , from Interstate 10 to downtown Casa Grande , was posted State Route 387 . Southeast from Casa Grande , State Route 93 overlapped State Route 84 to Tucson . When the Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 84 was truncated at the Picacho traffic interchange ( as was State Route 87 coming in from Coolidge , which to this day terminates there ) . State Route 84 now terminates in Casa Grande . After 1962 , State Route 93 remained cosigned with Interstate 10 from Picacho to Miracle Mile in Tucson , and then was cosigned with Business Loop 10 on Miracle Mile West ( formerly State Route 84A , now the southern-most leg of State Route 77 ) , and then cosigned again with U.S. 80 and U.S. Route 89 ( and State Route 789 , a strange little highway ) down Oracle Road/Miracle Mile/Oracle Road to Drachman Street . ( State Route 789 was delisted about 1966 , U.S. 80 was truncated at Benson in about 1977 . ) In Tucson , the highways zigged three blocks east on Drachman Street to Stone Avenue and then headed south to downtown Tucson . The creation of a one-way northbound Sixth Avenue in the late 1960s , paired with a one-way southbound Stone Avenue from the railroad tracks south to Tucson 's Five Points at 17th Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sixth , and they jagged west on Drachman . This put all the northbound highways on what then and now are residential streets . This one-way couplet was being removed by Tucson engineers at this writing , March 2008 . From 17th Street , both directions of U.S. 80/89 and State Route 93/789 extended south on 6th Avenue through South Tucson to the old South Tucson interchange . This was Arizona 's first cloverleaf , although the ramp curves were basically 50ft m radius U-turns to the right onto a frontage road . It was streamlined into a diamond interchange by 1964 . Old pictures exist of the signs marking U.S. 80 to the north on 6th Avenue and east on Benson Highway , State Route 84 to the west on the new bypass ( which then and now was simply named Freeway , with addresses for roadside motels given as 400 N. Freeway ) , and State Route 86 to the south ( to Ajo Way , then west to Why ) and east ( to the Willcox cutoff ) , as well as U.S. 89 and State Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mexico , U.S. 89 and State Route 93 and 789 were co-signed to the Grand Avenue border gate in Nogales . Interstate 19 first appeared in a 5mi km stub between Interstate 10 and Valencia Road in about 1963 , and a one-mile ( 1.6 km ) orphan in Green Valley at the same time . The 1960-era highway exists nearly unchanged from Tucson to Green Valley , east of the new Interstate 19 in Tubac and Amado , and in Nogales. # State Route 153 # State Route 153 , also known as the Sky Harbor Expressway , was a state highway in Maricopa County , Arizona , that used to run from the intersection of 44th Street and Washington Street in Phoenix south to University Drive . It was a controlled access arterial expressway , with a speed limit of 45mi/h km/h , lower than the standard freeway speed of 65mi/h km/h . SR 153 was also a north-south route that skirts the eastern edge of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport , and along with SR 143 , SR 153 served a portion of East Valley residents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SR 143 instead , because of its quick access to and from Interstate 10 and Loop 202 . SR 153 did , however , provide a direct link between east Phoenix , such as office developments in the Southbank commercial project , and the city of Tempe. # State Route 160 # State Route 160 was an east-west state highway in north-central Arizona , starting in the city of Payson and ending . in the city of Show Low , traveling along much of the Mogollon Rim . It first appeared on a state map in 1955 and was decommissioned in 1969 when State Route 260 took over its route . This route has no relation to U.S. Route 160 which was established on a different alignment in the northeastern corner of the state . # State Route 164 # State Route 164 was a state highway in the northern part of the state of Arizona . It had two routes in its brief history . From 1960 to 1962 , it started in the city of Flagstaff , at U.S. 66 and U.S. 89 and ended at the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The route then became part of U.S. Route 180 , when it was extended further west . From 1962 to 1970 , it started in the town of Tuba City and ended at the Four Corners in the northeastern corner of Arizona . It was decommissioned when U.S. Route 160 took over its route . route= previousroute=160 nextroute=166 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 166 # State Route 166 , also known as SR 166 , was a state highway in the north-central part of Arizona , starting at a junction with U.S. Route 66 and ended at the Walnut Canyon National Monument . It first appeared on a state map in 1957 and was decommissioned in 1971 when the route through the national monument was taken over by the Forest Service . It also appeared in older state maps on a route from Winslow to Second Mesa . Also known as the Winslow-Toreva Highway , the route became a part of State Route 87 . There is a historical marker about this highway north of Winslow . route= previousroute=164 nextroute=169 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 170 # State Route 170 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway in eastern Arizona . It was an older route of U.S. Route 70 and State Route 73 . It had a total length of 4 mi . The route was decertified in 2003 . The road still exists today as Indian Route 170. route= previousroute=169 nextroute=172 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 172 # State Route 172 was a state highway along the western part of Arizona . It was established for a route from the town of Parker to Parker Dam , along the Colorado River . It existed between 1958-1962 . After the dam was completed the route was decertified . The road up to the dam site still exists today as a county route . It was the only spur route of State Route 72 . The route is now a part of State Route 95. # State Route 173 # State Route 173 was a north-south state highway in north-central Arizona , that connected Show Low and McNary Jct. , now known as Hon Dah . The route and travels along part of the Mogollon Rim . It first appeared on a state map in 1946 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This route was a spur of State Route 73 which was the eastern terminus . # State Route 279 # State Route 279 was a state route that originally ran from present dayState Route 89A in Cottonwood to Interstate 17 in Camp Verde . The route first appeared in the state map in 1955 and was decertified when State Route 260 was extended to the west in the early 1980s . By that time , State Route 79 was replaced with Interstate 17 as well . The entire route was replaced by State Route 260 when the 260 designation was extended from Payson across State Route 87 and the General Crook Trail . Although most of SR 279 was replaced by SR 260 , there are two separate parts where the new highway does not run on top of the original . The first stretch is in Cottonwood on Camino Real heading south from SR 89A , where the road continues into SR 260 according to most maps ; however , the pavement ends at Odgen Ranch Road . The second stretch is on the western side of Camp Verde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SR 260 at the picnic tables to the west , returning to SR 260 before reaching I-17 . This segment is not paved along its entire length . # State Route 280 # State Route 280 was a state highway in Yuma County , Arizona that ran from its junction with Interstate 8 in Yuma to the Interstate 8 business loop . The route was turned over to the city of Yuma in April 2007 for maintenance . The road is now Avenue 3E , yet signage for SR 280 remains , including exit signs for Avenue 3E on Interstate 8 . SR 280 was the shortest state highway in Arizona , 1.47mi km . It existed wholly within the city of Yuma and served the Yuma International Airport . route= previousroute=279 nextroute=286 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 360 # State Route 360 was a state route located in the Phoenix , Arizona area of the United States . From 1970 to 1992 , SR 360 was assigned along the Superstition Freeway from Interstate 10 in Tempe through Mesa to U.S. Route 60 in Apache Junction . In 1992 , US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of SR 360 , was realigned onto the Superstition Freeway , replacing SR 360 in its entirety . # State Route 364 # State Route 364 , also known as SR 364 , was a state highway in the northeastern corner of the state of Arizona , starting in the town of Teec Nos Pos and ending at the state-line near the Four Corners . It first appeared on a state map in 1962 and was decommissioned in 1964 when the road was renumbered to U.S. Route 160 . Its parent route was State Route 64 and a majority of its historical route was also taken by U.S. Route 160 around the same time . # State Route 464 # State Route 464 was a state highway in the northeastern corner of the state of Arizona , starting in the town of Kayenta and ending at the town of Mexican Hat . It was a sister route of State Route 64 . It first appeared on a state map in 1962 and was decommissioned in 1970 when the route was renumbered to U.S. Route 163 . The route goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 504 was a state highway in the northeastern corner of the state of Arizona , starting in the town of Teec Nos Pos and ending at the New Mexico state line , only 2 mi away . It continued on as State Route 504 . It first appeared on a state map in 1965 and was decommissioned around 1989 when the route was renumbered to U.S. Route 64 . It was the shortest state highway in Arizona during its entire existence . # State Route 789 # State Route 789 was a state highway in the eastern part of the state of Arizona , starting in the town of Nogales and ending at the New Mexico state line near Gallup on old U.S. Route 66 ( presently Interstate 40 ) . The route was cosigned with other routes , including U.S. Route 89 North from Nogales to Tucson , U.S. Route 80/U.S . Route 89 north from Tucson to U.S. Route 60 and U.S. Route 70 at Florence Junction , east on 60/70 to Globe and then 60 past Show Low to State Route 61 , then east on 61 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 666 and U.S. 66 to Gallup N.M . It first appeared on an Arizona state map in 1956 and was decommissioned around 1965 when the route was decertified . State Route 789 was a leg of a proposed U.S. 789 , a number proposed for the Canada to Mexico Highway . Boosters wanted to route this new highway marked from Nogales , Arizona , north to Sweetgrass , Montana . Since the highway was to be routed along existing U.S. highways for the majority of its journey , an application for this route to be signed as a U.S. highway was denied by AASHTO . One remnant of U.S. 789 in Wyoming remains to this day as Wyoming 789 . U.S 789 was to continue north with U.S. 666 through Farmington into Cortez , Colorado . U.S. 160 and State Route 789 turned east to serve Durango . At Durango , State Route 789 turned north again , this time via U.S. 550 . At Montrose , State Route 789 followed U.S. 50 northwest to Grand Junction , then turned east again , this time via U.S. 6-24 ( now Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north along Colo. 13 , which took State Route 789 to its present Wyoming routing at Baggs . State Route 789 is still designated through Wyoming today ; see the routing section above . North of Frannie , State Route 789 continued into Montana via U.S. 310 to Laurel . State Route 789 turned east via U.S. 10-212 ( now Interstate 90 and U.S. 212 ) into Billings . U.S. 87 and State Route 789 merged from Billings all the way to Great Falls , which brought SR 789 westward again . Then State Route 789 turned due north along U.S. 91 ( now I-15 ) to its end at Sweetgrass , Montana . As the Association of American State Highway Administrators never approved the concept of U.S. 789 , all the state route segments started to disappear , with State Route 789 decertified about 1965 . The only stand-alone section of putative U.S. 789 is a section of Wyoming 789. route= previousroute=587 nextroute=801 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR
