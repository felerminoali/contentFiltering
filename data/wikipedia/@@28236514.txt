It was first played in the United States in 1876 , introduced by James Gordon Bennett , Jr . ( May 10 , 1841 May 14 , 1918 ) , who had first observed the game played in England . Bennett came to be known as father of American polo as it was he who assembled the players , knowledge , equipment and Texas horses to play the first loosely structured matches in the United States . During that winter of 1876 , the first game was held indoors at Dickels Riding Academy in New York and the first formal U.S. club was established , the Westchester Polo Club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island before making Newport its permanent home . On May 13 , 1876 , the Jerome Park Racetrack in Westchester County ( future home of the New York Giants baseball team and hence the name polo grounds ) was the site of the first outdoor polo match . Then in 1879 Meadowbrook became a polo club and began play on the Mineola fairgrounds of Long Island . The foundation had now been laid for American polo and the sport was here to stay and flourish . As players and teams proliferated , the development of the sport demanded a governing body . The Polo Association ( later known as the United States Polo Association ) , with H.L. Herbert serving as first chairman , was founded March 21 , 1890 . The USPAs purpose was to coordinate games , standardize rules and establish handicaps . Mr. Herbert was credited with instituting a handicapping system in 1888 so that teams could be more evenly matched in games . His rating system is essentially the same today , with player handicaps spanning minus one through 10 , with 10 being highest handicap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , continued to guide the Association until 1921 . Hazard then followed as USPA Chairman until 1922 . The first USPA headquarters was appropriately located in New York , the center of polo at that time . The Association began operations on a voluntary basis of committee structure and continues as such today with a small office staff . Elected Officers and Governors serve annually along with appointed Committee Members . USPA membership originally included seven clubs and , the following year , 142 players registered and there were five new clubs . In its early days of organization , the Association initiated changes in the number and length of time periods ( chukkers ) in a match . Equipment became standardized and pony training improved significantly . Scoring was also adjusted to allow for fractioning of points for penaltieslater abolished as an unnecessarily complex method of scoring that was replaced with free shots . Even before the Association was formed the Westchester Cup , one of the oldest tournaments in the world , was contested in 1886 by the United States and Britain . This prestigious international polo tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wimbledon and the British Open were all new events in a sparse sporting calendar . Though the British won that first match at Westchester easily , the Americans would use the defeat as a catalyst to improve their game strategy and the quality of their horses . The Association continued the series and the United States won nine of the next eleven matches including the 1939 competition , when the tournament was played for the last time at Meadowbrook before a crowd of 40,000 . The Cup was not played again until 1988 , when the United States defeated an Australasian team in Lexington , Kentucky . The U.S. won again against England in 1992 and later lost to the British in 1997 . In 1904 another important tournament evolved , the United States Open . The first Open was won by the Wanderers , who scored 4-1/2 to the Freebooters 3 . The tournament resumed in 1910 and continued every year with the exception of 1911 , 1915 , 1917 , 1918 , and 1942-1945 . The U.S. Open Polo Championship would become polos most prestigious tournament still played annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , Florida . The excitement of the sport was contagious ; many of the early polo matches in the 1920s and 1930s attracted as many as 20,000 spectators . This would be an impressive attendance even by todays standards , yet when one considers the communication and transportation capabilities of that era it was truly incredible . The center of much of this excitement was Meadowbrook Polo Club in Westbury , NY , the site of many of the first U.S. Open and Westchester Cup Championships . During the 1913-14 , the Westchester Cup packed 20,000 spectators into the stands . Even as polo gained in popularity across the country , eventually extending west to Texas , California and Hawaii , Meadowbrook would dominate the sport and be the center of polo during the first half of the century . During these early years of the USPA , one of the more famous players in polo was Foxhall Keene , handicapped for 14 years at 10 goals , and then 16 years at 9 goals . Though there were many other greats , four players stood out in the 1890s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Waterbury brothers , Larry and Monty and Devereux Milburn . These four players were known as the original Big Four and won the Westchester Cup in 1909 , 1911 , and 1913 . Milburn would go on to play in seven international matches and established a reputation as one of the most outstanding players of all time . Credited with creating and leading the Big Four , Harry Payne Whitney played a pivotal role in the sport by helping develop a more fluid open form of play integrating better teamwork . By 1913 , Circuit Cup play began with the first USPA Inter-circuit Cup held in 1916 . The USPA claimed 1,407 members and began registration of the ponies as well though pony registration would later be dropped in the 1920s . College polo came of age and indoor polo grew in popularity championed by George Sherman and Robert A. Graviss . Contributing to the growth of polo during this period was the U.S. Army , who after joining the USPA in 1902 , encouraged their members to participate in polo to improve their riding ability . From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant role in growing and sustaining the sport of polo by adding significant numbers of players and polo ponies . Polos greatest era began in the years between the first and second World Wars . The sport not only survived the Great Depression , but expanded into the 1930s with increased international competition . The number of registered clubs had increased to 88 and playing membership was 2,889 , of which 1,276 were military players . Louis Stoddard , a ten-goal player and member of two Westchester Cup Championship teams served as Chairman from 1922 to 1936 . He would direct and expand the USPA during the period of great change . Other great names in polo emerged , such as ten-goaler Tommy Hitchcock , Jr. , who reigned for 20 years and captured Americas hearts . Both of Hitchcocks parents were strong supporters of polo ; his mother taught young children the game and coached many polo players to greatness . Thomas Hitchcock , Sr. was also an outstanding player who was rated at ten goals in 1891 . By 1928 , another international match , The Cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. and Argentina . The U.S. Team won the first two competitions ; however , from 1936 , Argentina would go on to be the victor in future matches . The 1930s also saw women creating an impact on the sport , though they would not become official USPA members for years to come . During polos heyday it was only fitting that Hollywood would become involved with this great sport . With a wonderful climate for the game and the appeal for movie stars and moguls , California polo expanded . The geographic spread of polo led to the first East-West match up in 1933 , with the West winning two of three matches , proving the Westerners were a force with which to be reckoned . Humorist Will Rogers , a talented player and supporter of polo was thrilled . He is still remembered today as saying , The hillbillies beat the dudes and took the polo championship right out of the drawing room and into the bunkhouse . The Great Depression eventually took its toll on the fabric of American society and polo , like most things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , the number of civilian players dropped from 1600 to 750 . Though the number of military players peaked in 1940 with 1,432 registered members , Army polo would later disappear as the mechanization of the era outmoded the need for the cavalry . From 1942-1945 USPA tournaments were not played , though polo continued on private fields . Chairman , R.E . Strawbridge , Jr. , headed the Association from 1936-1940 , followed by Elbridge T. Gerry to 1946 and then Strawbridge served again from 1946-1950 . Polo survived after the war , thanks in great part to Cecil Smith of Plano , Texas , considered one of the first professional or paid players . By 1950 , the number of active clubs was 56 with 614 USPA playing members . Devereux Milburn , Jr. , son of the great 10-goal star , served as Chairman of the Association from 1950 to 1960 . The early 50s also marked the closing of Meadowbrook to make way for a highway ; Meadowbrook relocated to Jericho , Long Island . The club would never regain its earlier dominance . A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the first U.S. Open was played there in the 1950s , the ascent of Oak Brook began and continued as American interest in polo revived during the 1960s . USPA clubs increased to 77 and 675 players were registered . The Indoor Polo Association combined with the USPA in 1954 . Indoor polo , also known as arena polo - expanded the scope of the sport and intercollegiate polo made a comeback with George C. Sherman , Jr . serving as USPA Chairman from 1960 to 1966 . In 1967 the USPA moved its headquarters from New York to Oak Brook , the new home of American polo . This era also marked the introduction of sponsor money for horses and professional players . With the help of William T. Ylvisaker , the Polo Training Foundation was established in 1967 for the purpose of raising donations for the purposes of teaching polo fundamentals and improving the sport . In 1970 the Association listed 100 clubs and 917 registered players . Northrup R. Knox would head the USPA from 1966 to 1970 , followed by William Ylvisaker 1970-1975 and Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about increased popularity in polos major tournaments and in the club ranks . Polo flourished in Florida , encouraged by John T. Oxleys interest in high-goal polo and William T. Ylvisakers promotion of the sport by courting corporate sponsorship . International play increased as the Camacho Cup , played at Juarez , Mexico , was revived . Norman Brinker closed out the decade as USPA Chairman from 1976 to 1980 . Polo evolved from a society sport to include a far broader base of budget-minded horsemen , professional players and commercial sponsorship . With William Sinclaire as Chairman in 1980 , the USPA registered 134 clubs and almost 1,400 players . Sinclaire was followed by S.K. Johnston , Jr . as Chairman from 1984 to 1988 who oversaw the move of the USPA offices to Lexington , KY . With the dominance of Oak Brook fading , the polo centers of the 1980s grew to include Florida , Texas and California . In 1986 the United States Polo Association moved its national headquarters to a more central location in the heart of thoroughbred country , Lexington , KY . Pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1989 Federation of International Polo World Championship in West Berlin , Germany . Eight teams from all over the world battled with the U.S. team riding away as the victor over Britain in the final match . Led by Chairman , John C. Oxley ( 1988-1991 ) prior to and during the Centennial year of the United States Polo Association , one looked back fondly at the memories and heritage of yesteryear and forward with anticipation to another glorious 100 years . Since that time , Chairmen Stephen A. Orthwein ( 1991-1995 ) , Richard C. Riemenschneider ( 1995-1999 ) , Orrin H. Ingram ( 1999-2003 ) , Jack Shelton(2003-2007) , Thomas Biddle , Sr. ( 2007-2011 ) and current chairman Charles Weaver ( 2011- ) have made great strides in the areas of umpiring , safety , rules , rules interpretation , development of international rules , and refinement of the handicapping process . The USPA completed two major strategic planning efforts ( 2005 and 2011 ) that resulted in many new and innovative programs and services that were designed to grow and sustain the sport .
