height = ' ' Zvezda ' ' ( , meaning star ) , DOS-8 , also known as the ' ' Zvezda Service Module ' ' , is a component of the International Space Station ( ISS ) . It was the third module launched to the station , and provides all of the station 's life support systems , some of which are supplemented in the USOS , as well as living quarters for two crew members . It is the structural and functional center of the Russian portion of the station - the Russian Orbital Segment . The module was manufactured by RKK Energia , with major sub-contracting work by GKNPTs Khrunichev . ' ' Zvezda ' ' was launched on a Proton rocket on July 12 , 2000 and docked with the ' ' Zarya ' ' module on July 26 . The rocket used for the launch was one of the first to carry advertising ; it was emblazoned with the logo of Pizza Hut restaurants , for which they are reported to have paid more than US$1 million . The money helped support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising agencies that orchestrated the event . # Origins # The basic structural frame of ' ' Zvezda ' ' , known as DOS-8 , was initially built in the mid-1980s to be the core of the ' ' Mir-2 ' ' space station . This means that ' ' Zvezda ' ' is similar in layout to the core module ( DOS-7 ) of the ' ' Mir ' ' space station . It was in fact labeled as ' ' Mir ' ' -2 for quite some time in the factory . Its design lineage thus extends back to the original Salyut stations . The space frame was completed in February 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by October 1986 . The MIR-2 space station was redesigned after the failure of the Polyus orbital weapons platform core module to reach orbit . Zvezda is around 1/4 the size of Polyus , and has no armaments . # Design # Zvezda consists of a cylindrical Work Compartment where the crews work and live , a cylindrical Transfer Chamber which has one docking port , an unpressurized Assembly Compartment surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three docking ports ( four docking ports total ) . The component weighs about 18051kg lb and had a length of 13.1 m . The solar panels extend 29.7 m . The Transfer Compartment attaches to the ' ' Zarya ' ' module , and has docking ports intended for the Science Power Platform and the Universal Docking Module . As in the early days of ' ' Mir ' ' , the transfer compartment provides a suitable EVA airlock where spacewalkers in Orlan suits removed a hatch after closing a few that connected the compartment to the rest of the station . It was used only during Expedition 2 , where two men put a docking cone on the nadir port . The lower port connects to ' ' Pirs ' ' and the top port connects to ' ' Poisk ' ' . Eventually , the plan for Pirs is for it to be deorbited and replaced by the Multipurpose Laboratory Module . The Assembly Compartment holds external equipment such as thrusters , thermometers , antennas , and propellant tanks . The Transfer Chamber is equipped with automatic docking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Zvezda ' ' can support up to six crew including separate sleeping quarters for two cosmonauts at a time . It also has a NASA-provided Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System and a bicycle for exercise , a toilet and other hygiene facilities and a galley with a refrigerator and freezer . The module contains the primary Russian computers for guidance and navigation . ' ' Zvezda ' ' has 14 windows There are two 9inmm adj=mid windows , one in each of the two crew sleep compartments ( windows No. 1 and 2 ) . Six 9inmm adj=mid windows ( No. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ) on the forward Transfer Compartment earth facing floor . As well a 16inmm adj=mid window in the main Working Compartment ( No. 9 ) and one 3inmm adj=mid window in the aft transfer compartment ( No. 10 ) . There are a further three 9inmm adj=mid windows in the forward end of the forward transfer compartment ( No. 12 , 13 and 14 ) , for observing approaching craft . Note : Window No. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zvezda ' ' also contains the Elektron system that electrolyzes condensed humidity and waste water to provide hydrogen and oxygen . The hydrogen is expelled into space and the oxygen is used for breathing air . The condensed water and the waste water can be used for drinking in an emergency , but ordinarily fresh water from Earth is used . There are 16 small thrusters and two large thrusters for propulsion , and eight batteries for storing power . The Elektron system has required significant maintenance work , having failed several times and requiring the crew to use the Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator canisters ( also called Oxygen Candles , which were the cause of a fire on ' ' Mir ' ' ) when it has been broken for extended amounts of time . It also contains the Vozdukh , a system which removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas . ' ' Zvezda ' ' has been criticized for being excessively noisy and the crew has been observed wearing earplugs inside it . Zvezda contains the ESA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connection to the ISS # On July 26 , 2000 , ' ' Zvezda ' ' became the third component of the ISS when it docked at the aft port of ' ' Zarya ' ' . ( ' ' Zarya ' ' had already been attached to the U.S. ' ' Unity ' ' module . ) Later in July , the computers aboard ' ' Zarya ' ' handed over ISS commanding functions to computers on ' ' Zvezda ' ' . On September 11 , 2000 , two members of the STS-106 Space Shuttle crew completed final connections between ' ' Zvezda ' ' and ' ' Zarya ' ' ; during a 6 hour , 14 minute EVA , astronaut Ed Lu and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko connected nine cables between ' ' Zvezda ' ' and ' ' Zarya ' ' , including four power cables , four video and data cables and a fiber-optic telemetry cable . The next day , STS-106 crew members floated into ' ' Zvezda ' ' for the first time , at 05:20 UTC on September 12 , 2000 . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life support system , a communication system ( ' ' Zvezda ' ' introduced a 10 Mbit/s Ethernet network to the ISS ) , electrical power distribution , a data processing system , a flight control system , and a propulsion system . These quarters and some , but not all , systems have since been supplemented by additional ISS components . The two main engines on ' ' Zvezda ' ' can be used to raise the station 's altitude . This was done on April 25 , 2007 . This was the first time the engines had been fired since ' ' Zvezda ' ' arrived in 2000. # Launch risks # Due to Russian financial problems , ' ' Zvezda ' ' was launched with no backup and no insurance . Due to this risk , NASA had constructed an Interim Control Module in case it was delayed significantly or destroyed on launch . # Interior #  File:Zvezda toilet.jpgZvezda 's space toilet File:Forward view of interior of Zvezda.jpgForward view of interior of Zvezda **62;1328277;TOOLONG of the Galley  # Crew #  File:ISS christmas 2009. jpgCrewmembers celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Zvezda crew quarters **43;1328341;TOOLONG in Zvezda , November 2000 .
