full name = ' ' Jennings v Rice ' ' 2002 is an English contract law case concerning proprietary estoppel. # Facts # Mr Jennings , a gardener , sued the administrator of his former employer , Mr Rice , to have a large house worth 435,000 conveyed to him on the ground that he had been given an assurance he would get it . Mrs Royle , who lived at Lawn House , Shapwick , Somerset , died on August 11 , 1997 aged 93 , without a will or children . Mr Jennings had worked as her gardener since 1970 , but from the late 1980s had increasingly begun to care for her , doing washing , helping dressing , shopping and going to the toilet . She was running out of money and could not continue to pay him . She told him he need not worry about that since he would be alright and that this will all be yours one day . Mr Jennings claimed that either there was a claim under the Inheritance Act 1970 , or there was a contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of proprietary estoppel . The administrator contested the payment . The High Court awarded him 200,000 taking into account the payments Mr Jennings had forgone on the basis of proprietary estoppel , after rejecting the IA 1970 claim , and stating that Mrs Royle 's words had been too vague to make a contract . Mr Jennings appealed arguing that he should get the full sum even under proprietary estoppel , while Mr Rice argued that although the full value of the house was the maximum awardable , the court should take into account the actual detriment experienced . # Judgment # The Court of Appeal held that the High Court had made a correct assessment , and proportionality was essential between expectation and detriment in deciding how to satisfy an equity based on proprietary estoppel . Although the detriment to Mr Jennings was more difficult to establish than his expectation , courts must consider unconscionability . In agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed , Robert Walker LJ said the following . 43 . It can not be doubted that in this as in every other area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can not exercise a completely unfettered discretion according to the individual judge 's notion of what is fair in any particular case . Dr Gardner 's fourth hypothesis ( the approach is for the court to adopt whatever style and measure of relief it thinks fit , for whatever reason it thinks fit ) can not be right . I do not think that the judgment of Hobhouse LJ in ' ' Sledmore v Dalby ' ' ( 1996 ) 72 P&amp;CR 196 ( to which I shall return ) can possibly be regarded as adopting or advocating an unfettered judicial discretion . 44 . The need to search for the right principles can not be avoided . But it is unlikely to be a short or simple search , because ( as appears from both the English and the Australian authorities ) proprietary estoppel can apply in a wide variety of factual situations , and any summary formula is likely to prove to be an over-simplification . The cases show a wide range of variation in both of the main elements , that is the quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of the claimant 's detrimental reliance on the assurances . The doctrine applies only if these elements , in combination , make it unconscionable for the person giving the assurances ( whom I will call the benefactor , although that may not always be an appropriate label ) to go back on them . 45 . Sometimes the assurances , and the claimant 's reliance on them , have a consensual character falling not far short of an enforceable contract ( if the only bar to the formation of a contract is non-compliance with section 2 of the Law of Property ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) Act 1989 , the proprietary estoppel may become indistinguishable from a constructive trust : ' ' Yaxley v Gotts ' ' 2000 Ch 162 ) . In a case of that sort both the claimant 's expectations and the element of detriment to the claimant will have been defined with reasonable clarity . A typical case would be an elderly benefactor who reaches a clear understanding with the claimant ( who may be a relative , a friend , or a remunerated companion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefactor , the claimant will inherit the benefactor 's house ( or will have a home for life ) . In a case like that the consensual element of what has happened suggests that the claimant and the benefactor probably regarded the expected benefit and the accepted detriment as being ( in a general , imprecise way ) equivalent , or at any rate not obviously disproportionate . Cases of that sort , if free from other complications , fit fairly comfortably into Dr Gardner 's first or second hypothesis ( both of which aim to vindicate the claimant 's expectations as far as possible , and if possible by providing the claimant with the specific property which the benefactor has promised ) . 46 . However the claimant 's expectations may not be focused on any specific property . In ' ' Re Basham ' ' 1986 1 WLR 1489 the deputy judge ( Mr Edward Nugee QC ) rejected the submission that there must be some clearly identified piece of property , and that decision has been approved more than once in this court . Moreover ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the claimant 's expectations may have been formed on the basis of vague and inconsistent assurances . The judge said of Mrs Royle that she .. was prone to saying different things at different times and , perhaps deliberately , couched her promises in non-specific terms . He made that observation in relation to the failure of the contract claim , but it is relevant to the estoppel claim also . 47 . If the claimant 's expectations are uncertain ( as will be the case with many honest claimants ) then their specific vindication can not be the appropriate test . A similar problem arises if the court , although satisfied that the claimant has a genuine claim , is not satisfied that the high level of the claimant 's expectations is fairly derived from his deceased patron 's assurances , which may have justified only a lower level of expectation . In such cases the court may still take the claimant 's expectations ( or the upper end of any range of expectations ) as a starting point , but unless constrained by authority I would regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not see that approach as being inconsistent with authority . On the contrary , I think it is supported by a substantial body of English authority . Scarman LJ 's well-known reference to the minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff ( ' ' Crabb v Arun District Council ' ' 1976 Ch 179 , 198 ) must no doubt be read in the context of the rather unusual facts of that case , but it does not stand alone . As Scarman LJ recognised , the line of authority goes back to nineteenth-century cases such as ' ' Duke of Beaufort v Patrick ' ' ( 1853 ) 17 Beav.60 and ' ' Plimmer v Wellington Corporation ' ' ( 1884 ) 9 App Cas 699 . A passage in the opinion of the Privy Council ( delivered by Sir Arthur Hobhouse ) in Plimmer 's case at pp.713-4 is particularly instructive . The conclusion of the passage is that In fact the court must look at the circumstances in each case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied . Scarman LJ 's reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutionally parsimonious , but it does implicitly recognise that the court must also do justice to the defendant . 49 . It is no coincidence that these statements of principle refer to satisfying the equity ( rather than satisfying , or vindicating , the claimant 's expectations ) . The equity arises not from the claimant 's expectations alone , but from the combination of expectations , detrimental reliance , and the unconscionableness of allowing the benefactor ( or the deceased benefactor 's estate ) to go back on the assurances . There is a faint parallel with the old equitable doctrine of part performance , of which Lord Selborne said in ' ' Maddison v Alderson ' ' ( 1883 ) 8 App Cas 467 , 475 , In a suit founded on such part performance , the defendant is really ' charged ' upon the equities resulting from the acts done in execution of the contract , and not ( within the meaning of the statute ) upon the contract itself . So with proprietary estoppel the defendant is charged with satisfying the equity which has arisen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint since in the case of estoppel there is no contract and the nexus between the benefactor 's assurances and the resulting equity is less direct ; the assurances are only half the story . In ' ' Dillwyn v Llewelyn ' ' ( 1862 ) 4 De G F &amp; J 517 , 522 Lord Westbury expressed the point in terms which anticipated Lord Selborne : The equity of the donee and the estate to be claimed by virtue of it depend on the transaction , that is , on the acts done , and not on the language of the memorandum which amounted to an imperfect gift . 50 . To recapitulate : there is a category of case in which the benefactor and the claimant have reached a mutual understanding which is in reasonably clear terms but does not amount to a contract . I have already referred to the typical case of a carer who has the expectation of coming into the benefactor 's house , either outright or for life . In such a case the court 's natural response is to fulfil the claimant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or extravagant , or out of all proportion to the detriment which the claimant has suffered , the court can and should recognise that the claimant 's equity should be satisfied in another ( and generally more limited ) way . 51 . But that does not mean that the court should in such a case abandon expectations completely , and look to the detriment suffered by the claimant as defining the appropriate measure of relief . Indeed in many cases the detriment may be even more difficult to quantify , in financial terms , than the claimant 's expectations . Detriment can be quantified with reasonable precision if it consists solely of expenditure on improvements to another person 's house , and in some cases of that sort an equitable charge for the expenditure may be sufficient to satisfy the equity ( see Snell 's Equity 30th ed para 39-21 and the authorities mentioned in that paragraph ) . But the detriment of an ever- increasing burden of care for an elderly person , and of having to be subservient to his or her moods and wishes , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimant may not be motivated solely by reliance on the benefactor 's assurances , and may receive some countervailing benefits ( such as free bed and board ) . In such circumstances the court has to exercise a wide judgmental discretion . 52 . It would be unwise to attempt any comprehensive enumeration of the factors relevant to the exercise of the court 's discretion , or to suggest any hierarchy of factors . In my view they include , but are not limited to , the factors mentioned in Dr Gardner 's third hypothesis ( misconduct of the claimant as in ' ' J Willis &amp; Sons v Willis ' ' 1979 Ch 261 or particularly oppressive conduct on the part of the defendant , as in ' ' Crabb v Arun District Council ' ' or ' ' Pascoe v Turner ' ' 1979 1 WLR 431 ) . To these can safely be added the court 's recognition that it can not compel people who have fallen out to live peaceably together , so that there may be a need for a clean break ; alterations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assurances have been given , and the claimant 's detriment has been suffered , over a long period of years ; the likely effect of taxation ; and ( to a limited degree ) the other claims ( legal or moral ) on the benefactor or his or her estate . No doubt there are many other factors which it may be right for the court to take into account in particular factual situations . 53 . The judge did in this case consider , although not in detail , what Mr Jennings might reasonably have earned in the way of arm 's length remuneration for his services . He also considered what professional nursing care might have cost during the last eight years of Mrs Royle 's life . A detailed computational approach was adopted ( but with a different outcome , limited to compensation of reliance loss ) by the Supreme Court of Tasmania in ' ' Public Trustee v Wadley ' ' 1997 7 Tas . LR 35 in which the court discussed the appropriate hourly rate and the total number of hours of housework undertaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenting judgment of Wright J ) had subordinated her own life to that of her father and whose attentive and affectionate service , often no doubt at considerable inconvenience to herself , put her assistance on a higher plane than that of a domestic servant . 54 . That illustrates the Australian preference for compensating the reliance loss only . Under English law that approach may sometimes be appropriate ( see paragraph 51 above ) but only where , on the facts , a higher measure would amount to overcompensation . In my view it would rarely if ever be appropriate to go into detailed inquiries as to hours and hourly rates where the claim was based on proprietary estoppel ( rather than a restitutionary claim for services which were not gratuitous ) . But the going rate for live-in carers can provide a useful cross-check in the exercise of the court 's discretion . 55 . I have made some references to the general trend of Australian jurisprudence in this area . It is unnecessary to attempt any detailed study of the different views expressed by the High Court in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very different context of litigation arising out of personal injuries suffered in a collision between two warships ) or of Australian cases since then . 56 . However I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Hobhouse LJ in ' ' Sledmore v Dalby ' ' ( 1996 ) 72 P&amp;CR 196 , that the principle of proportionality ( between remedy and detriment ) , emphasised by Mason CJ in Verwayen , is relevant in England also . As Hobhouse LJ observed at p.209 , to recognise the need for proportionality .. is to say little more than that the end result must be a just one having regard to the assumption made by the party asserting the estoppel and the detriment which he has experienced . The essence of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel is to do what is necessary to avoid an unconscionable result , and a disproportionate remedy can not be the right way of going about that . Cases on interim injunctive relief have recognised the importance of proportionality in the granting of equitable remedies : see for instance ' ' Lock International v Beswick ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court is granting final relief after investigating all the facts proportionality is even more important . 57 . I do not consider that the judge made any error of law in his approach to the exercise of his discretion , or that it was otherwise flawed . He did make an error in his reference to the quantum of the relief granted in Gillett v Holt ( the claimant was awarded a farmhouse and 42 hectares of land as well as 100,000 ) . But every case depends on its own facts and that slip can not in my view have played a significant part in the judge 's disposal of the case . 58 . I would therefore dismiss this appeal .
