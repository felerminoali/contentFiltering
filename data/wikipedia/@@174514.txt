The River Mole is a tributary of the River Thames in southern England . It rises in West Sussex near Horsham and flows north west through Surrey for 80km mi to the Thames at East Molesey , opposite Hampton Court Palace . The river gives its name to the Surrey district of Mole Valley . The Mole crosses the North Downs between Dorking and Leatherhead , where it cuts a steep-sided valley , known as the Mole Gap , through the chalk . Much of the catchment area lies on impermeable rock ( including Wealden Clay and London Clay ) , meaning that the river level responds rapidly to heavy rainfall . During the second half of the 20th century pollution levels in the river were high , however since 1995 the water quality has improved dramatically and the Mole now boasts the greatest diversity of fish species of any river in England . Twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) that include wetland habitats are located within the Mole catchment area and the stretch of river through Leatherhead has been designated a Local Nature Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Conservation and is an SSSI of European importance . The river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets , particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between Dorking and Leatherhead ( most recently during the 1976 drought ) . In John Speed 's 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend The river runneth under . However the river 's name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour : The ' ' Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names ' ' suggests that ' ' Mole ' ' either comes from the Latin ' ' mola ' ' ( a mill ) or is a back-formation from ' ' Molesey ' ' ( Mul 's island ) . Domesday Book lists twenty mills on the river in 1086 , of which Sidlow Mill was the oldest , dating from Saxon times . # Catchment area # The drainage area of the River Mole is 512 km and forms 5% of the River Thames catchment area above Teddington . Annually the catchment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average level of rainfall is 800 mm rain around Crawley . The Mole catchment reaches a maximum elevation of 265m ft above Ordnance Datum at Leith Hill to the south west of Dorking . There is only one aquifer in the drainage basin , at Fetcham , which means that the majority of the water in the river is from surface drainage , particularly from Gatwick Airport and the urban areas of Horley and Crawley , and that the flow rate responds rapidly to rainfall . # Course # # Upper Mole # River Mole rises in Baldhorns Copse 0.7kmmi 1 to the south of the village of Rusper in West Sussex . The river flows initially southwards for 1kmmi 1 to a small lake at Baldhorns Park , before running eastwards through a largely rural area towards Crawley . The first tributaries to join the young river drain the northernmost part of St Leonard 's Forest , between Horsham and Crawley , although much of the forest is in the catchment area of the River Arun . The Mole skirts the northern suburbs of Crawley where it is joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ifield Mill Pond . The first gauging station on the Mole is south of Gatwick Airport ( 57 m above OD ) . **16;3929;ref The gauging station south of Gatwick Airport was installed in 2005 , replacing an earlier station located 200 m ( 200 yds ) downstream . The mean flow is 0.33m3/s cuft/s and the river ran dry at this point for the first time in the summer of 1995 . The Mole runs under the airport runway in a culvert completed in 1985 . The course of the Mole within the airport perimeter has been altered several times since commercial flights began in 1945 ; however the meanders visible on the 1839 tithe map in the 1.5 km stretch immediately north of the runway were reinstated in 1999 , in a 1.2 million project to facilitate airport expansion . The Mole enters Surrey to the south of Horley , where it meets the Gatwick Stream , a tributary draining Worth Forest to the southeast of Crawley . The second-largest Sewage Treatment Works ( STW ) in the Mole catchment is located on the Gatwick Stream 3km mi upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 megalitres ( 15,000 m  3  ) of water per day , and in prolonged dry periods it accounts for up to 75% of the flow of the Mole downstream of the confluence . The mean flow measured at Horley gauging station ( 52 m above OD ) is 1.40m3/s cuft/s . The Mole passes Horley to the west , flowing north towards Sidlow and entering a largely rural area . 0.7kmmi 1 south of Sidlow the mean flow is measured as 2.21m3/s cuft/s at Kinnersley Manor gauging station ( 48 m above OD ) . The Earlswood Brook , a tributary draining the urban area of Reigate and Redhill , joins the Mole at Sidlow . The largest STW in the Mole catchment ( Reigate STW ) discharges up to 118.5 megalitres per day into the Earlswood Brook . **16;3947;ref A principal tributary of the Earlswood Brook is the Redhill Brook , which includes The Moors wetland nature reserve within its catchment area . From Sidlow the Mole turns north west towards Brockham . A number of minor tributaries join the river from the west and are typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horsham and Dorking . The 18th century weir at Betchworth was modified in 2004 to facilitate the installation of two 27.5 kW low-head hydro turbines . About 90% of the energy generated is fed into the regional electricity grid , while the remainder is used to supply the Betchworth Park Estate , where the weir is situated . The river leaves the Wealden Clay at Brockham , passing Betchworth Castle and flowing briefly across greensand and Gault Clay to Pixham , 1kmmi 1 north east of Dorking . A mean flow of 3.74m3/s cuft/s is measured at a fourth gauging station , located at Castle Mill ( 39 m above OD ) . At Pixham the Mole meets the Pipp Brook , a tributary draining the northeastern slopes of Leith Hill . **16;3965;ref The Pipp Brook drains the northernmost heavily wooded slopes of Leith Hill ( which include Squire 's Great Wood and Abinger Forest ) , as well as areas of Wotton , Westcott and Dorking . # Mole Gap # Between Dorking and Leatherhead the Mole cuts a steep-sided valley ( the Mole Gap ) though the North Downs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western flank of Box Hill and a smaller 50 m cliff at Ham Bank in Norbury Park . The sudden change from impermeable Wealden Clay to permeable chalk and the increased gradient of the river ( which drops 15 m in the six mile ( 10 km ) stretch between Brockham and Leatherhead , compared to 3 m in 12 mi between Horley and Brockham ) allow the water table to drop below the bed of the river . Water is able to flow out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks , decreasing the volume of water carried in the main channel . The course of the river through Norbury Park was partially straightened when the Epsom to Horsham railway was built in 1837 , with the removal of a small meander north of Westhumble . The meander was reinstated in 1997 , in an attempt to enhance this area of the Park , although it has since become blocked by silt . The entirety of the Mole Gap lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . # Lower Mole # At Leatherhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow across impermeable London Clay , winding towards Cobham . The water table rises at this point and much of the water which drained out of the channel through the chalk returns through springs in the riverbed . The aquifer at Fetcham is the only one in the entire catchment area . The next major tributary , The Rye , ( which drains Ashtead ) joins to the north of Leatherhead , before the river is crossed by the M25 motorway . At Cobham the river swings round in a pronounced axe-head meander skirting Painshill Landscape Garden , where a 35 ft diameter waterwheel raises water 5 m from the river to feed the ornamental lake in the park . **16;3983;ref The undershot wheel at Painshill Park was restored in 1987 and is located at the end of an artificial leat , rather than on the main river channel . From Painshill Park the river flows northeastwards to the Thames , passing to the west of Esher Commons and then forming the boundary between Hersham and Esher , where the mean flow of the river is 5.43m3/s cuft/s . In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 1968 , the river was modified downstream of Albany Bridge to the Thames and new flood defences were constructed . Finally the Mole splits into two branches at the Island Barn Reservoir near Molesey : the northern ( and smaller ) branch continues as the River Mole and the southern branch is known as the River Ember . The two rivers flow either side of the reservoir , before running side by side in a north easterly direction , merging 400 m before the confluence with the River Thames , on the reach above Teddington Lock . ( For the purposes of the remainder of this article , the River Mole and the River Ember are treated as a single entity . ) Prior to the last Ice Age , the River Thames followed a more northerly route to the North Sea , from Reading via Marlow , Chorleywood , St Albans , Hertford and along the present Suffolk-Essex border . During this period , the Mole is thought to have merged with the River Wey near Byfleet and then flowed in a north-easterly direction via Richmond to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wey are less than 2km mi apart at their closest point near Painshill Park ) . During the Middle Pleistocene period , **16;4001;ref The Middle Pleistocene period was ca. 781,000-126,000 years ago a large ice sheet built up across much of the East of England , reaching as far south as St Albans and Chelmsford , blocking the path of the proto-Thames . Glacial meltwater from the Anglian ice sheet , caused the Thames to divert southwards and flood the valley of the Mole-Wey river , thus adopting its present route through London . # Ecology # # Water quality # The water quality of the watercourses in the River Mole catchment area has improved dramatically since the 1990s . In 1990 the Environment Agency assessed only 23% of the watercourses as Grade B ( good ) or better , but by 2002 60% had reached this standard . Investment in the Sewage Treatment Works within the catchment area has improved the quality of the discharges into the river and modifications to the runway and apron drainage systems at Gatwick Airport means that surface water is diverted to aerated pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released into the river . There have been a number of high profile pollution incidents of the river in recent years : In 2003 , Gatwick Airport Ltd pleaded guilty to charges of allowing chemical pollution to enter the River Mole after a detergent , used to clean rubber and oil from the runway , was washed into Crawters Brook by airport workers . The Environment Agency estimated that up to 5200 fish of 14 different species were killed as the pollution spread downstream . The airport was fined 30,000 by Lewes Crown Court . In May 2003 , sewage leaking from a pump operated by Thames Water leaked into the Stanford Brook killing a number of coarse fish in the Gatwick Stream . # Biodiversity # The Marsh Frog ' ' Pelophylax ridibundus ' ' ( a non-native species introduced from Europe in the 1930s ) is now commonly found in the upper Mole and its tributaries around Newdigate and Gatwick . There is no evidence that the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians . A second non-native species , the Edible Frog ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a site at Newdigate in the early 1900s . It has in 2008 been recorded in tributaries of the River Mole at Capel and Brockham . The River Mole has the most diverse fish population of any river in England . The Gatwick Stream is dominated by coarse fish such as brown trout , brook lamprey , and eel . In 2003 , the upper River Mole near Meath Green Lane , Salfords , was enhanced to create a gravel spawning area to encourage chub and dace in addition to roach . In 1974 zander , a non-indigenous coarse fish native to Europe , were introduced legally to Old Bury Hill Lake which supplies the Pipp Brook . Zander have been caught in the Lower Mole below Dorking since the 1980s . In the Mole Gap between Dorking and Leatherhead the river supports populations of chub , dace , barbel , brown trout . Both barbel and brown trout are extremely sensitive to water quality and pollution . Below Leatherhead the river has historically supported larger predatory fish including chub , perch , pike , and eels , however in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . North of Esher the old river channel is dominated by floating pennywort , a highly invasive weed , which cuts off all light to the river bed , reducing oxygen levels and resulting in a poor habitat for fish . The Ember flood relief channel has a diverse fish population , including chub , dace , roach , bleak , large pike and barbel . At the confluence of the Mole and the River Thames at Hampton Court Palace it is possible to catch a wide variety of coarse fish species . The geographical distribution of many species of invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area . Viviparid snails and water scorpions ( of the genus ' ' Nepidae ' ' ) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay . Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around Brockham and the tributaries which run over the Wealden Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies , caddisflies , fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles . The Beautiful Demoiselle ( ' ' Calopteryx virgo ' ' ) disappeared from the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has since recolonised . The White-legged Damselfly ( ' ' Platycnemis pennipes ' ' ) is also found along the river and the Downy Emerald ( ' ' Cordulia aenea ' ' ) is found between Box Hill and Leatherhead . The Mole is one of only three locations in England where the River Shingle Beetle ' ' Meotica anglica ' ' is found . A nationally scarce species which is locally common on the River Mole is the Greater Dodder ' ' Cuscuta europaea ' ' . # Conservation # The Mole catchment area includes twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) which include wetland habitats and the stretch of river through Leatherhead has been designated a Local Nature Reserve . The Mole Gap forms part of a Special Area of Conservation and is an SSSI of European importance . The stretch of river between Thorncroft Manor ( 1 km south of Leatherhead ) and River Lane in Fetcham has been designated a Local Nature Reserve . Although much of the surrounding land has been taken by residential and commercial development , this section of the Mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 species of dragonfly . The geology of the local area is complex , since the river leaves the chalk of the Mole Gap at this point and flows over gravel and clay , creating a patchwork of different habitats including scrub , woodland , hedges , banks , and meadows as well as the water itself . The river also provides a corridor for wildlife through the centre of Leatherhead . The West End Common forms part of the Esher Commons , owned and managed by Elmbridge Borough Council . The River Mole forms the western boundary of the common , flowing past a steep sandy area known locally as ' ' The Ledges ' ' . Plant species typical of ancient woodland are found in this area , including bluebells ( ' ' Hyacinthoides non-scriptus ' ' ) , Marsh Marigolds ( ' ' Caltha palustris ' ' ) and Golden Saxifrages ( ' ' Chrysosplenium ' ' sp . ) . Large Bittercress ( ' ' Cardamine amara ' ' ) and the non-native Himalayan Balsam ( ' ' Impatiens glandulifera ' ' ) are also found along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the west bank of the Mole , west of the Island Barn Reservoir . The Heath is an area of rough scrubland and , despite its name , is a reclaimed landfill site hence its large but artificial mound and small plateau . The site is a rich habitat for birds including the redshank and Little Ringed Plover. # Angling # Below is a list of the coarse fish records for the river Mole l Barbel - 15 lb 6oz l Roach - 2 lb 5oz l Chub - 6 lb 12oz l Pike - 25 lb 2oz l Carp - 35 lb l Perch - 2 lb 15oz # Geology # # Upper Mole **27;4019;span ( geology )  # The Mole above Dorking drains an area of 340km2 sqmi , of which approximately 60% is on Wealden Clay or Atherfield Clay , 20% is on Tunbridge Wells Sand and 20% is on greensand . Brickearth deposits are common in the valley around Betchworth and east of Dorking . The upper Mole catchment is dominated by a single broad terrace , which runs continuously from the entry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meath Green ( near Horley ) , the terrace corresponds to the flood plain of the river , however from this point downstream to Brockham , the river cuts a narrow trench no more than 150m wide . A similar trench is runs up several of the Mole 's tributaries , notably along Deanoak Brook which follows a local strike . The presence of the trench protects the land from flooding rendering it suitable for agriculture . # Mole Gap **27;4048;span ( geology )  # Between Dorking and Leatherhead the Mole cuts a steep-sided valley through the North Downs , creating a 170 m high river cliff on the western flank of Box Hill . The bedrock is permeable chalk and the water table lies permanently below the level of the riverbed , allowing water to drain out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks . The amount of water lost from the river is significant and in very hot summers the channel can become dry between Mickleham and Thorncroft Manor ; this was recorded most recently in 1949 and 1976 . At Leatherhead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this point that the water table rises enough for the water to flow back into the main river channel . In a survey in 1958 , the geologist C.C. Fagg identified 25 active swallow holes between Dorking and Mickleham ; most were only a few centimetres in diameter and were located in the vertical banks of the river below the water line . Most holes were difficult to observe in times of normal or heavy flow and were susceptible to silting up as new holes were continually being formed . A few much larger swallow holes were also observed separated from the main river by a channel of about a metre . About six of these larger swallow holes were found to the west of the Burford Bridge Hotel , along the course of the A24 Mickleham Bypass during its construction in 1936 . Initially the surveyors tried to fill the holes with rubble to prevent the foundations of the new road subsiding . However this proved to be impractical and they were instead covered by concrete domes , up to 18 m in diameter , each fully supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access shaft to allow periodic inspection . In the late 1960s the domes were reopened and inspected and the alluvium in the largest swallow hole was observed to have subsided by under the centre of one of the domes . When the Dorking to Leatherhead railway was constructed in 1859 , a fossilised swallow hole was discovered in the cutting at the south end of Box Hill and Westhumble railway station , suggesting that even in its early history , the river had swallow holes . The author Daniel Defoe , who attended school in Dorking and probably grew up in the village of Westhumble , described the swallow holes in the River Mole in his book ' ' A tour thro ' the Whole Island of Great Britain ' ' ( first published in 1724 ) : # . the current of the river being much obstructed by the interposition of those hills , called Box Hill .. it forces the waters as it were to find their way through as well as they can ; and in order to do this , beginning , I say , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Box-Hill , called the Stomacher , the waters sink insensibly away , and in some places are to be seen ( and I have seen them ) little channels which go out on the sides of the river , where the water in a stream not so big as would fill a pipe of a quarter of an inch diameter , trills away out of the river , and sinks insensibly into the ground . In this manner it goes away , lessening the stream for above a mile , near two , and these they call the Swallows . # Not all of the water removed from the river by the swallow holes is returned to the channel at Leatherhead . The chalk aquifer also feeds the springs at the southern end of Fetcham Mill Pond , which have never been known to run dry . A survey in March 1883 estimated that the Fetcham springs were producing about 3.6 million gallons of water ( 16,000 m  3  ) every day . A second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 million gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The water table in the chalk of the Wey Gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone . It has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the Mole Gap . # Lower Mole **27;4077;span ( geology )  # At Leatherhead the river leaves the chalk bedrock , moving onto London Clay . The river meanders across an alluvial plain between 400 and 800 m wide towards Cobham , where it begins to descend to a lower flood plain which in turn broadens to the axehead meander at Painshill Park . At the east end of Painshill Park , the lower flood plain abruptly narrows to form a narrow trench about 60 m wide , in which the river runs northwards for 6.5km mi towards Hersham , where the river enters the flood plain of the River Thames . There are a series of gravel deposits laid down by the river above the London Clay between Cobham , Walton-on-Thames and Esher . The depth of the deposits generally varies from 2.5mft sigfig=1 to 7mft sigfig=1 , and the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron oxide , whilst the upper layers are loosely packed with angular flints and sand . Remains of a further gravel terrace containing both cherts and flints to a depth of 4mft sigfig=2 are located along the side of St George 's Hill . # History # # Etymology # The river is first recorded in the ' ' Red Book of Thorney ' ' in AD 983 as ' ' Emen ' ' and in the AD 1005 ' ' Cartulary of the Abbey of Eynsham ' ' as both ' ' Emen ' ' and ' ' men ' ' . Variations in the name are recorded throughout the Middle Ages and the river appears as ' ' Amele ' ' in Domesday Book and subsequently as ' ' Emele ' ' in 12th and 13th century Court Rolls . This name is probably derived from the Old English word ' ' men ' ' meaning ' ' misty ' ' or ' ' causing mists ' ' , and the name of the River Ember probably has its origins in this name . **16;4106;ref The prefix of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as Emley Bridge in some 19th century records , probably also has its origins in the Old English word ' ' men ' ' . The name ' ' Mole ' ' does not appear until the 16th century , first occurring as ' ' Moule ' ' in Harrison 's ' ' Description of Britain ' ' of 1577 . The antiquarian William Camden uses the Latinized form ' ' Molis ' ' in the 1586 edition of ' ' Britannia ' ' and Michael Drayton is the first to use ' ' Mole ' ' in his poem ' ' Poly-Olbion ' ' published in 1613 . In John Speed 's 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend The river runneth under . However the river 's name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour : The ' ' Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names ' ' suggests that ' ' Mole ' ' either comes from the Latin ' ' mola ' ' ( a mill ) or is a back-formation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In John Rocque 's 1768 map of Surrey , the name ' ' Moulsey River ' ' is used . # Archaeology # In common with much of the rest of the Weald , the earliest evidence of human settlement along the Upper Mole is from the Mesolithic Period ( 20 000 - 7000 BC ) . Mesolithic sites at Wonham , Flanchford and Sidlow . Finds at Wonham include arrowheads and a plano-convex knife . The Lower Mole appears to have been settled during the same period and a flint axe dating from Mesolithic period found on spit of land close to River Mole in Cobham in 1965 . Remains of a flat-bottomed dug-out canoe were found at the confluence of the Mole and Thames in 1877 by a local boatman . The canoe is preserved at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford . The Mole Gap and North Downs do not appear to have been settled until the late Stone Age : A large axe , typical of a rough-out axe produced during the Neolithic period , which was discovered in 1952 during building work in Westhumble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at East Horsley along with neolithic flakes of flint at Fetcham and Headley Heath . Significant Bronze Age finds include a bronze sword found close to the river north of Amberley Farm near Charlwood and a small hoard of weaponry consisting of two palstave axes and a scabbard chape was discovered in 2003 in Norbury Park close to Ham Bank . # Navigation # It is not clear to what extent the Mole was used for navigation in the past : In the late 13th century , Thorncroft Manor ( south of Leatherhead ) purchased a ' ' shout ' ' , a type of boat up to 16 m in length used to carry produce to market and it has been suggested that stone cut from quarries in Reigate was transported to London via the river . During the 17th century , two bills came before parliament to make sections of the river navigable . The first , in 1663 , was passed by the House of Commons but was defeated in the House of Lords . During the following year ( 1664 ) , an act was passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Reigate to the River Thames , but was never executed . The only Surrey river to have been made fully navigable is the River Wey . In 1798 William Marshall advocated the canalisation of a short stretch of the River Mole between Betchworth and Dorking to facilitate the movement of chalk from quarry to market . In 1810 the engineer John Rennie proposed a canal linking the River Medway to Portsmouth which was to have a branch to London following the Mole for much of its length . Between 1825 and 1828 the architect and civil engineer Nicholas Wilcox Cundy proposed a Grand Imperial Ship Canal from Deptford to Chichester passing through the Mole Gap , however he was unable to attract sufficient financial interest in his scheme . Today the Mole is navigable for the 400 m from the confluence with the River Thames to Molember Weir at East Molesey where there is a private mooring facility . The river may be paddled all year by canoe between Brockham and Fetcham with an appropriate licence from the British Canoe Union . # World War II defences # During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mole were fortified for the defence of London against invasion from the south . GHQ Line B ran along the North Downs from Farnham and Guildford , crossing the Mole Gap to the north of Dorking and following the river to Horley . Between Betchworth and Box Hill , the north bank of the River Mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing . At Boxhill Farm , where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows , a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti-tank measure . Gun mounts were also installed to protect both Boxhill and Deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were installed . An anti-tank ditch was dug from the Stepping Stones eastwards across the fields belonging to Bradley Farm ( now Denbies vineyard ) . The river crossing at Sidlow Bridge was heavily defended and a line of pill boxes was constructed on the north bank of the river . Concrete anti-tank dragon 's teeth were built on both sides of the river , a short distance upstream of the bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mole # # Mole Gap # The North Downs Way crosses the river at Box Hill via seventeen hexagonal stepping stones , which are frequently submerged after heavy rainfall . The current stones were dedicated in September 1946 by the then Prime Minister Clement Attlee , replacing those destroyed during WW2 as an anti-invasion measure . The location is popular both with anglers and families , although swimming is strongly discouraged as the water is polluted in places . The stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of Westhumble . When the Burford Bridge was rebuilt in 1937 , excavations revealed a flint-surfaced approach to a ford at low level having all the signs of Roman workmanship suggesting that Stane Street ( which ran from London to Chichester via Dorking ) crossed the river at this point . In Defoe 's time , there was a footbridge at this point , but carts and waggons had to cross the river by a ford . # Leatherhead # There are three listed bridges in Leatherhead of which the 14 arch Leatherhead Town Bridge is the oldest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Middle Ages and was rebuilt and enlarged by the county surveyor George Gwilt in 1782-83 . The bridge is a long structure of 14 segmental arches resting on low piers , finished in red brick in Flemish bond , with some Portland stone dressing . A few metres downstream of Leatherhead Bridge stands the Grade II listed railway viaduct which carries the Leatherhead to Dorking line over the river . The bridge was constructed in 1867 and , at the insistence of Thomas Grissell the landowner , was given lavish architectural treatment . The single span Shell Bridge stands in the grounds of Thorncroft Manor , to the south of the Town Centre . The bridge was constructed as an ornamental feature in parkland laid out by Capability Brown in the late 18th century . The bridge is largely composed of flint and has a large inverted scallop shell in the place of the keystone and similar shells in the spandrels at each side . The bridge was renovated and strengthened in 1999 by a group of Canadian engineers working on the Terra Nove project .

The present bridge was constructed by George Gwilt in 1792 , after responsibility for maintenance had been transferred to the County Council by Act of Parliament . The bridge has nine low arches and is primarily built of red brick with stone coping . The parapets were rebuilt in 1914 and the structure was given a Grade II listing in 1953. # Watermills # Domesday Book listed twenty mills on the River Mole in 1086. # Upper Mole # Horley Mill was first mentioned in a deed of the early thirteenth century . The most recent mill was demolished in 1959 , although the mill house still stands . The first mill at Sidlow was built during Saxon times . The final mill on the site was demolished in 1790 , however remains of the mill leat are still visible . Mention is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill race are still visible . # Lower Mole # Slyfield Mill near Stoke d'Abernon is first mentioned in Domesday Book . It was used for fulling woollen cloth and milling corn . Five of the mills mentioned in Domesday Book were in the borough of Elmbridge . Downside Mill , Cobham was the mill of the manor of Downe . Until the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was owned by Chertsey Abbey . It has been used for many purposes including the processing of corn , paper , iron , tinplate and flock and the generation of electricity . The present building dates from the 18th century but it is inaccessible to the public . Cobham Mill , downstream of Leatherhead , consisted of two mills used for grinding corn . In 1953 the larger mill was demolished by Surrey County Council to allieviate traffic congestion on Mill Road . The remaining red brick mill dates from the 1822 and was in use until 1928 . It was restored to full working order by the Cobham Mill Preservation Trust , and is now open to the public from 2 pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( between April and October ) . Esher Mill was at the end of Lower Green Road where there is now an industrial estate . It was used to process corn , brass wire , iron , paper , linoleum , and books . For many years there may have been two mills on the site for corn grinding and industrial use . There were a series of fires over a century and after the last in 1978 the buildings were demolished . East Molesey Upper Mill was associated with the manor of Molesey Matham . It was used to produce gunpowder from the time of the Commonwealth until about 1780 . The island where it stood now forms part of the ornamental gardens of a housing development called The Wilderness . East Molesey Lower Mill , also known as Sterte Mill , was associated with the manor of Molesey Prior . During the Commonwealth it was used for gunpowder manufacture , but after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 it reverted to corn milling . An old timber structure was replaced by a brick building in the 1820s which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampton Court Way . In addition there was Ember Mill , which stood on the banks of the old course of the River Ember near Hampton Court Way . # River Ember Flood Relief Channel and confluence with the Thames # The River Mole originally flowed into the River Thames at the point where the present Hampton Court bridge now crosses the Thames ( approximately 500 m upstream of the present confluence , on the reach above Teddington Lock ) . However , during the early 1930s , when Hampton Court Way and the bridge were built , the River Mole was redirected to flow into the River Ember and both rivers now enter the Thames in a single widened and straightened channel once occupied only by the River Ember . There have been further alterations to the courses of these two rivers in a major flood prevention scheme since serious flooding in the area in 1947 and 1968. # Literature # The river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets , particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between Dorking and Leatherhead ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Faerie Queene ' ' ( first published in 1590 ) Edmund Spenser wrote of the river : # : And Mole , that like a nousling mole doth make : His way still under ground till Thamis he overtake . # In ' ' Poly-Olbion ' ' ( first published in 1612 ) the poet Michael Drayton described the journey taken by the River Thames to the sea : # : As still his goodly traine yet every houre increast , : And from the ' ' Surrian ' ' shores cleer ' ' Wey ' ' came down to meet : His Greatnes , whom the ' ' Tames ' ' so gratiously doth greet : That with the Fearne-crown 'd Flood he Minion-like doth play : : Yet is not this the Brook , entiseth him to stay . : But as they thus , in pompe , came sporting on the shole , : Gainst ' ' Hampton-Court ' ' he meets the soft and gentle ' ' Mole ' ' . : Whose eyes so pierc't his breast , that seeming to foreslowe : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : With trifling up and down , he wandreth here and there ; : And that he in her sight , transparent might appeare , : Applyes himselfe to Fords , and setteth his delight , : On that which might make him gratious in her sight . : But ' ' Tames ' ' would hardly on : oft turning back to show , : For his much loved ' ' Mole ' ' how loth he was to go . : The mother of the ' ' Mole ' ' , old ' ' Holmsdale ' ' , likewise beares : Th'affection of her childe , as ill as they do theirs : : But ' ' Mole ' ' respects her words , as vaine and idle dreames , : Compar 'd with that high joy , to be belov 'd of ' ' Tames : ' ' : And head-long holds her course , his company to win . : ' ' Mole ' ' digs her selfe a path , by working day and night : ( According to her name , to shew her nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles space doth creep : : Till gotten out of sight , quite from her mothers keep , : Her foreintended course the wanton Nymph doth run ; : As longing to imbrace old ' ' Tame ' ' and ' ' Isis ' ' son .. # He writes in the appendix to Song XVII # This ' ' Mole ' ' runnes into the earth , about a mile from ' ' Darking ' ' in ' ' Surrey ' ' , and after some two miles sees the light againe , which to be certaine hath been affirmed by Inhabitants thereabout reporting triall made of it . # John Milton ( c. 15621647 ) described the river as # : sullen Mole that runneth underneath # In a similar vein , Alexander Pope ( 16881744 ) wrote in his poem ' ' Windsor Forest ' ' ( first published 1713 ) # : And sullen Mole that hides his diving flood # Robert Bloomfield ( 17661823 ) writes the following lines about the Mole Valley in his 1806 poem ' ' Wild Flowers ' ' . # : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thy balm that softens human ills ; : Come on the long drawn clouds that fling : Their shadows o'er the Surry-Hills . : Yon green-topt hills , and far away : Where late as now I freedom stole , : And spent one dear delicious day : On thy wild banks romantic Mole . : Ay there 's the scene ! Beyond the sweep : Of London 's congregated cloud , : The dark-brow 'd wood , the headlong steep , : And valley paths without a crowd ! : Here Thames I watch thy flowing tides , : Thy thousand sails am proud to see ; : But where the Mole all silent glides : Dwells Peace - and Peace is wealth to me . # Extract from ' ' The River Mole or Emlyn Stream ' ' by Mary Uniacke ( writing under her maiden name Mary Drinkwater-Bethune ) , which was published in 1839 . # : Who may count back that forgotten time : When first the waters forced an outlet here : : When the foundations of these stedfast hills : Were shaken , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That awful day : Yet leaves its trace . The waters find their way , : Now laughing in the sun - now swallowed up : In caverns pervious to their course alone , : They leave their channel dry , and hide awhile : Their silent flow ; like bitter tears , unshed : From the dim eye , before a careless world : Unheeding of our grief ; but swelling still : In the full heart , which leaves unsoothed , unseen , : And broods o'er ruined hopes , and days gone by . # # Tributaries # The major tributaries of the River Mole are the Ifield Brook , Gatwick Stream , Earlswood Brook , Pipp Brook and The Rye , which drains Ashtead .
