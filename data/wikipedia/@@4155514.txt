Although Peter Jr . and his brother had little formal education , they would both learn to speak German and English . He later married a German-Irish woman Myrtle Coppleman Gorman and did not let her know about his criminal activities , keeping her under the ruse that he worked as a travelling salesman . He was first incarcerated in 1902 and sent to the Joliet Correctional Center for burglary in 1906 .

While he was in prison , the North Side Gang became embroiled in a vicious gang war with the rival Chicago Outfit , headed first by Johnny Torrio and then Al Capone .

Kneeling in front of the doorway , Gusenberg emptied the entire 100-round capacity drum into the restaurant , and then casually strolled back to his car , which then sped off . The attack left Capone terrified and he offered a truce between the two gangs . Peace talks faltered on the concessions that the North Siders demanded . As the gang war continued , the North Side Gang started to weaken . Three weeks after the Hawthorne Hotel attack , Hymie Weiss was murdered by a Capone hit squad . Moran now took over the gang . The North Siders especially wanted to kill Jack Machine Gun McGurn , as he was rumored to have killed Weiss . On at least two occasions , the Gusenberg brothers tried to kill McGurn .

Peter 's brother Frank was the only initial survivor of the massacre . When police asked who had shot him , Frank replied , No one shot me . He died later that night . Although the killers wiped out most of the North Side Gang , they missed their prime target , Bugs Moran . Moran had pulled up to the garage just as the shooters were entering . Because they were dressed as policemen , Moran assumed it was a raid and fled the area . # Popular culture # Peter Gusenberg would be portrayed in two movies about the Prohibition era ; *In Roger Corman 's ' ' The St. Valentine 's Day Massacre ' ' ( 1967 ) , Gusenberg was played by George Segal . *In Steve Carver 's ' ' Capone ' ' ( 1975 ) , Gusenberg was played by Martin Kove. *The Gusenburg Sweeper is a Grand Theft Auto V version of the Tommy Gun , featured in the Valentine 's Day Massacre Special .
