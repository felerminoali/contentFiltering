deathplace = London Harriet Cohen CBE ( 2 December 1895 13 November 1967 ) was a British pianist . # Biography # Harriet Cohen was born in London and studied piano at the Royal Academy of Music under Tobias Matthay , having won the Ada Lewis scholarship at the age of 12 followed by the Sterndale Bennett Prize in 1913 . She made her debut at a Chappell 's Sunday concert at the Queen 's Hall a year later . Her first major appearance was in 1920 when she appeared at the Wigmore Hall in a joint recital with the tenor John Coates . She became particularly associated with contemporary British music , giving the world premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams ' Piano Concerto ( which was written for her ) and recording Edward Elgar 's Piano Quintet with the Stratton Quartet under the composer 's supervision . A number of composers wrote music specifically for her , including John Ireland , Bla Bartk , Ernest Bloch and E. J. Moeran , and particularly Sir Arnold Bax ( Cohen 's lover ) , who wrote most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Lean 's 1948 film version of ' ' Oliver Twist ' ' . He also composed Concertino for Left Hand for her after she lost the use of her right hand in 1948 . The last six pieces in the collection ' ' Mikrokosmos ' ' by Bartk are dedicated to her . Harriet Cohen dedicated an important effort to the performance of the Tudor composers at a time when this was unusual , and gave recitals of works by William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons and also of Henry Purcell . She was considered one of the finest performers of J. S. Bach 's keyboard music , winning outstanding praise from the musicologist Alfred Einstein . Pablo Casals , also , invited her to play Bach with his orchestra at Barcelona , and Wilhelm Furtwngler extended a similar invitation on hearing her in Switzerland . She gave the first ' all-Bach ' recital at the Queen 's Hall in 1925 . She also cultivated Spanish music , and gave the second performance of Manuel de Falla 's ' ' Nights in the Gardens of Spain ' ' , a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early exponent of music of the Soviet Union in Britain , and visited Russia in 1935 to broadcast from Moscow and Leningrad , including works by Shostakovich , Kabalevsky and Leonid Polovinkin . These composers later sent her further compositions . Cohen 's influence went well beyond that of a musician . She became strongly associated in the 1930s with publicising the plight of German and Austrian Jews and even played a concert with the scientist Albert Einstein ( Alfred 's cousin ) in 1934 to raise funds to bring Jewish scientists out of Germany . She became a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and Ramsay MacDonald as well as the first president of Israel , Chaim Weizmann . Cohen was also a close friend of many leading figures of the time . These included not only musicians such as Jean Sibelius , Ralph Vaughan Williams , Sir Edward Elgar and Sir William Walton , but also novelists such as Arnold Bennett , George Bernard Shaw , H. G. Wells and D. H. Lawrence as well as politicians or entrepreneurs such as Max Beaverbrook and Leslie Viscount Runciman . Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her day . She was Vice-President of the Women 's Freedom League , and was for several years associated with the Jewish National Fund and the Palestine Conservatoire of Music at Jerusalem . Cohen was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in 1938 . She died in London . The Harriet Cohen International Music Award was introduced in her honour in 1951 . In January 2006 , ' ' Dearest Tania ' ' , a words-and-music programme telling the story of Cohen , premiered , written by Duncan Honeybourne and performed with actress Louisa Clein. # Efforts for refugees from Nazism # Harriet Cohen met the American journalist Dorothy Thompson in 1930 on her first tour of America , a tour which took in New York , Washington and the Library of Congress and Chicago , thus finally establishing a name for herself on the International stage . It was a meeting that was to change Cohen 's life and awake her Jewish consciousness . In 1933 Harriet Cohen traveled to Vienna to play a number of concerts , staying with Dorothy Thompson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Jewish and non-Jewish , who were pouring into the city from Germany . Thompson and Cohen were to correspond about the plight of Jewish refugees in Austria and Germany . Cohen was then able to pass on information from Thompson directly to the British Prime Minister , Ramsay MacDonald , who was at this time her intimate friend . Cohen met Thompson every time she went to America thereafter . From 1933 Cohen committed herself to work in Britain and the United States on behalf of refugees . This would result in a concert in America with Albert Einstein in 1934 to raise funds to bring Jewish scientists out of Germany . In 1935 Ramsay MacDonald warned Cohen not to travel through Germany because the British Government would not be able to provide immunity for her . Soon after , Adolf Hitler passed the Nuremberg laws totally excluding Jews from public life . Harriet Cohen had met Albert Einstein in Germany in 1929 when she had afternoon tea at his house . At the time Einstein disclosed that he played the violin and said that one day they should play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had fled Germany in 1933 . Cohen would often visit him in Oxford , England where he settled for a short time . In 1934 , after Einstein moved to USA , Harriet Cohen did finally play that duet concert with Einstein to raise funds to bring Jewish scientists out of Nazi Germany . Cohen and Einstein remained friends thereafter and he referred to her as the beloved piano witch . It was not until 1939 when she first met Chaim Weizmann , the future first President of Israel , that she began to support the Zionist cause and a Jewish homeland . Cohen 's 1939 visit to Palestine extended her reputation there both as a concert pianist and politically . She argued with British and Jewish officials to try to get Jewish refugees admitted on ships from Nazi Germany ( rather than be returned ) , once almost precipitating an International incident . Harriet Cohen believed passionately in a Jewish homeland but with justice to the Arab Palestinians . She survived two assassination attempts during her trip to Palestine . It was when Cohen was having dinner with Weizmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's 1939 white paper to limit Jewish immigration to Britain to just 15,000 people a year . Blanche Dugdale , Lord Balfour 's niece , a fellow diner , prophetically said in an agonised voice , What will happen to the millions fleeing from Hitler ? # Russian composers # The visit in spring 1935 by Cohen to the Soviet Union was another major milestone in her career . It was the country from which her ancestors had fled 100 years earlier . Not only was Cohen bringing British music to the USSR by playing pieces by Vaughan Williams , Bax , Bliss and Ireland , she also performed Shostakovitch 's Preludes , Kabalevsky 's Sonatina , and the Soviet premiere of Leonid Polovinkin 's Suite from manuscript . Thereafter she took their music all over Europe and was acclaimed as the first musician outside the USSR to learn Shostakovitch 's Twenty-Four Preludes , which he composed in 1932 and 1933 . Her contribution in bringing to the attention of the world the work of unknown Russian composers is often forgotten . # Relationship with Sir Arnold Bax # One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love love without strife or fret or circumstances just the praise to you . My mouth longs for your soft mouth .. . These are just two quotes from the love letters between Sir Arnold Bax and Harriet Cohen . Harriet Cohen 's love affair with Bax lasted for over forty years until he died in 1953 . It was Bax who gave Harriet Cohen the name Tania , by which she was affectionately known by close friends and family . Their passionate affair started in 1914 when she was 19 and he was 31 , although they had met two years earlier . Bax was creatively inspired by Cohen and in 1915 wrote for her within 13 days three pieces including The Princess 's Rose Garden , The Maiden with the Daffodil and In the Vodka Shop . Some believe that their time together inspired his famous tone-poem ' ' Tintagel ' ' , in which he may have in part expressed his anguish at the dream their world denied . The affair led to Bax 's ultimate decision to leave his wife and children in 1918 , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce . Neither could their relationship be recognised publicly because of the social climate of their generation . Cohen possibly became pregnant with Bax 's child in 1919 but if she did , she lost the child in an early miscarriage . Harriet Cohen 's recently published letters reveal the turbulence and anguish of the relationship . Cohen always claimed that the long standing affair denied her becoming a Dame , but this is not substantiated . Through the 1930s their relationship became less passionate as her international career flourished , and Bax sought a quieter haven with his gentler mistress Mary Gleaves ; nonetheless the affair continued and they remained close , as private letters between Cohen and Bax reveal . In 1936 , for example , they travelled together to Stockholm and Helsinki and met Jean Sibelius , a composer who had long influenced Bax 's music . On 23 September 1947 , Bax 's wife Elsa ( Elsita ) died . Cohen probably expected to finally marry Bax after an affair that had now lasted 30 years . Events were to unfold quite differently . Bax did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fact she was to discover in May 1948 whilst recording the music that Bax had written for the film ' ' Oliver Twist ' ' , when Elsa 's will was published . A greater shock followed , when Bax revealed his secret twenty-year affair with Gleaves and his intention not to remarry . This was at a time when Cohen was losing prominence in Britain , and in May 1948 Cohen had an accident with a tray of glasses , which severed the artery in her right hand thus restricting her performing career for some years . When Bax died on 3 October 1953 , Cohen was deeply affected by his death . His will bequeathed half of his interest from his literary and musical compositions to Cohen for life , and half to Mary Gleaves . After their death his royalties and estate were to pass to his children . Cohen also kept the London property that Bax had bought for her - throughout Cohen 's life Bax had financially assisted her . # Other relationships # The British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald is one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the period when he was Prime Minister from 1929 to 1935 , at a time of economic instability and depression which saw the rise of Nazism and Fascism in Europe . It was rumoured that MacDonald and Cohen became lovers . Their letters reflect a closeness ; and she often visited him alone at 10 Downing Street and his home in Hampstead . Certainly many people did believe they were lovers and Cohen was often referred to as the old man 's darling . Cohen was also close to Max Beaverbrook , the founder of Express newspapers and an important entrepreneur of the day . Cohen was introduced to the business tycoon Max Beaverbrook by Arnold Bennett in 1923 . Beaverbrook was instantly charmed by Cohen and invited her to dine regularly with him from 1923 and through him met Lord Rothermere and Lloyd George . Beaverbrook and Cohen often met at her house , as noted in her autobiography ' ' A Bundle of Time ' ' . He was besotted with her in his own way and showered her regularly with a hundred or more roses . Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His letters to her reveal a flirtatious relationship , regularly reminding her of the thousands of kisses that she owed him . He was a regular visitor to her home and often attended Cohen 's little parties that she held for her friends . She loved entertaining and inviting famous and prominent people . Cohen premiered Vaughan Williams ' Hymn Tune Prelude in 1930 which he dedicated to her . She later introduced the piece throughout Europe during her concert tours . In 1933 she then premiered his Piano Concerto in C major , a work which was once again dedicated to her . Cohen was given the exclusive right to play the piece for a period of time . Harriet Cohen first played for Edward Elgar in 1914 at a party when she was 18 . They became close friends and this lasted until his death in 1934 . In 1933 Cohen organised a concert in his honour under the patronage of the King and Queen . Undoubtedly Elgar doted on Cohen and closely followed her career , giving her constant support . Under Elgar 's direction she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quartet . Elgar had only sketched it but he gave the short score to Harriet for the recording . H. G. Wells was part of Harriet Cohen 's circle of male admirers from the 1920s . After Wells parted from writer and novelist Rebecca West , it is well known that Wells took up brief liaisons with other women . Harriet Cohen is highly likely to have been one of these , as various letters from her private collection and interviews suggest . She had a magnetic personality and beauty which Wells found irresistible . D. H. Lawrence became a close friend of Harriet Cohen 's . It was clear already in 1915 that this friendship had created some tensions between Cohen and Arnold Bax . Bax protested at Cohen 's closeness to Lawrence . She told Lawrence that they would have to meet secretly . In demonstrative mood that day , Lawrence scrawled across her autograph book The door closed . A short time later Cohen contracted tuberculosis , possibly from Lawrence , who died of the disease in 1930 . Cohen to Bax always denied any sexual relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence and Cohen remained good friends and were regularly seeing each other as least as part of a group of friends up until his death . They would often talk together about the music of their common friend , the musician Elgar . Cohen was introduced to William Walton in 1923 by Arnold Bennett . They carried on a rather flirtatious friendship which Cohen described in her autobiography as stormy but delightful . She wrote that the irritation they often felt for each other did not lessen the underlying affection . Cohen championed Walton 's music both at home and abroad especially in the late 1920s and early ' 30s . On assigning to Cohen the premier performance of his Sinfonia Concertante in 1927 he said to her I know it will be in safe hands . Rosa Newmarch introduced Harriet Cohen to Jean Sibelius in London 1921 and they spent some time together . In the summer 1936 Cohen travelled in Finland with Arnold Bax and they had long discussions with Sibelius both in Helsinki and Ainola . Sibelius even wrote her the opening chord of his eight symphony which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably with Arnold Bennett . Arnold Bennett , dear friend and mentor of my youth died on 27 March 1931 wrote Cohen in her autobiography . Arnold Bennett was one of Cohen 's closest friends and responsible for introducing her to many of her new friends . Bennett introduced Cohen to William Walton and Max Beaverbrook in 1923 . Cohen was devastated on Bennett 's sudden death from typhoid fever on 27 March 1931 . She had spoken to him only a few days earlier , when he had told her how unwell he was feeling . It was Bennett who had kept Cohen on the rails for over a decade giving her honest , blunt necessary advice . Cohen listened to him and respected his judgement . He had guided her when she was in her 20s when her reputation and fame was growing both at home and abroad . # Cohen in novels # Harriet Cohen was portrayed in three novels . D. H. Lawrence based the main character of Harriet in his novel ' ' Kangaroo ' ' on Cohen . ' ' Kangaroo ' ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca West based the main character of Harriet in her novel ' ' Harriet Hume ' ' ( 1929 ) on Harriet Cohen . The novel is described as a modernist story about a piano-playing prodigy and her obsessive lover , a corrupt politician . The novel immortalised Harriet 's love affair with the composer Arnold Bax . William Gerhardie cast Cohen as the heroine Helen Sapphire in the book ' ' Pending Heaven ' ' and much of what is written mirrors Cohen 's own life and character as well as her turbulent relationship with Gerhardie . Helen Sapphire is a musician who performs successfully all over Europe . She plays the harp and the piano . Gerhardie personified himself in the central character of Max who dreams about Helen . # Further reading # * Cohen , Harriet ' ' A Bundle of Time ' ' ( 1969 ) * Brook , Donald , ' ' Masters of the Keyboard ' ' ( Rockliff , London 1955 printing ) , 151-152.
