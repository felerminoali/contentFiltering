Large offerings to Agwe are left on constructed rafts ( ' ' barques d'Agwe ' ' ) which are floated or towed out to sea . If the raft sinks , it is accepted ; if it returns to shore it is rejected . After the offering is left , the supplicants can not look back at that place or it will anger Agwe .

If it is offered ( perhaps to celebrate a bountiful year , good fortune , or a joyous occasion ) it must be prepared and then cooked in a pan or oven . Then ( to be fit for the table of the King of the Sea ) it must be served on a white china dish with blue patterns .
