Chen Yixing ( ) ( died 844 ) , courtesy name Zhoudao ( ) , was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty , serving twice as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Wuzong . He was viewed as a Li Faction leader in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles . # Background and early career # It is not known when Chen Yixing was born . It was said that his family had its origins south of the Yangtze River , but had , for generations , lived in Yingchuan ( , in modern Luoyang , Henan ) . Neither his grandfather Chen Zhong ( ) nor his father Chen Yong ( ) was listed with any offices in the table of the chancellors ' family trees in the ' ' New Book of Tang ' ' , suggesting that neither had an official title . He had at least three younger brothers , Chen Xuanxi ( ) , Chen Yize ( ) , and Chen Yishi ( ) . In 812 , during the reign of Emperor Xianzong , Chen passed the imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereafter , he served on the staffs of several regional governors . As of the end of ' ' Baoli ' ' era ( 825-827 ) of Emperor Xianzong 's grandson Emperor Jingzong , Chen was serving as an imperial censor with the title of ' ' Shiyushi ' ' ( ) , and serving at the eastern capital Luoyang , when he was made ' ' Yubu Yuanwailang ' ' ( ) , a low-level official at the ministry of public works ( , ' ' Gongbu ' ' ) . He continued to serve at Luoyang. # During Emperor Wenzong 's reign # # Before chancellorship # In 829 , during the reign of Emperor Jingzong 's brother Emperor Wenzong , Chen Yixing was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as an imperial chronicler ( , ' ' Qijulang ' ' ) , and he also served as an editor in imperial history , participating in the compilation of the chronicles of Emperor Xianzong 's reign . After those chronicles of Emperor Xianzong 's reigns were presented to Emperor Wenzong in 830 , Chen was made ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ministry of civil service affairs ( , ' ' Libu ' ' ) . In 831 , he was promoted to be ' ' Libu Langzhong ' ' ( ) , a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service affairs . Later in the same year , he was also made an imperial scholar ( , ' ' Hanlin Xueshi ' ' ) . In 834 , he was also made a tutor to the Crown Prince Li Yong and ordered to attend to and lecture Li Yong on the Confucian classics once every five days . He was further given the office of ' ' Jianyi Daifu ' ' ( ) , an advisory official , and put in charge of drafting edicts . In 835 , he was made the deputy minister of worship ( , ' ' Taichang Shaoqing ' ' ) , and continued to serve in his capacities as imperial scholar , tutor to Li Yong , and drafter of edicts. # During and after chancellorship # In 837 , when Chen Yixing was also serving as the deputy minister of public works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was made a chancellor ' ' de facto ' ' with the designation ' ' Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ' ' ( ) , serving alongside Li Shi and Zheng Tan . As of 838 , by which time Li Shi had resigned and Yang Sifu and Li Jue had been made chancellors as well , it was said that Chen was honest in his opinions and therefore despised Yang for what he viewed as Yang 's grab on power , and they often argued when discussing policy matters . Chen thus offered to resign , but Emperor Wenzong declined his resignation . After this incident , he continued to frequently , in veiled terms , accuse Yang of stealing imperial authority while discussing issues . ( Modern historians such as Bo Yang viewed these arguments as factional in nature , and considered Chen and Zheng to be among the leaders of the Li Faction in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles ( named after Li Deyu ) , while viewing Yang and Li Jue to be among the leaders of the Niu Faction ( named after Niu Sengru ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former chancellor Li Zongmin , also considered a Niu Faction leader , who had been exiled , promoted and moved closer to the capital , Chen opposed vehemently , and it was said that from this point on , all policy arguments were complicated by partisan issues , making it difficult for Emperor Wenzong to rule on them . In 839 , there was a major argument that led to the removals of Chen and Zheng . Emperor Wenzong had praised the talents of the acting director of finances , Du Cong . Yang and Li Jue thereafter recommended Du to be the ministry of census . Chen responded , Such orders should come from the Emperor . In the past , those who lost stately sovereignty did so by losing their authorities to their subjects . Li Jue responded , Your Imperial Majesty had told me previously that an Emperor should select chancellors , not suspect them . In a subsequent discussion , Chen again emphasized that the Emperor should not yield authority to his subjects . Li Jue , offended , responded , Chen Yixing is obviously suspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial Majesty . I have often requested retirement , and I would be fortunate to be given a post as an imperial prince 's teacher . Zheng then stated , Your Imperial Majesty ruled well in the first and second years of the ' ' Kaicheng ' ' era ( i.e. , 836 and 837 ) , while less so in the third and fourth years of ' ' Kaicheng ' ' ( i.e. , 838 and 839 ) . Yang responded , In the first and second years , Zheng Tan and Chen Yixing were in power . In the third and fourth years , your subject and Li Jue joined them . Of course , the crime is mine . He then stated , I do not dare to again enter the Office of the Chancellors ! He withdrew from Emperor Wenzong 's presence . Emperor Wenzong subsequently sent a eunuch to comfort him , and Zheng partially apologized , stating , Your subject is foolish . I did not intend to point at Yang Sifu , but Yang Sifu 's reaction shows that he has no tolerance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance is deteriorating year by year . This does not only incriminate your subject , but also speaks ill of your holy virtues . Yang then submitted multiple offers to resign . Soon thereafter , Zheng and Chen were stripped of their chancellor posts . Chen , instead , was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs ( , ' ' Libu Shilang ' ' ) . Later in the year , he was sent out of the capital to serve as the prefect of Hua Prefecture ( , in modern Weinan , Shaanxi ) . # During Emperor Wuzong 's reign # In 841 , by which time Emperor Wenzong 's brother Emperor Wuzong was emperor and Li Deyu was the leading chancellor , Chen Yixing was recalled from Hua Prefecture , apparently first to serve as chief imperial censor ( , ' ' Yushi Daifu ' ' ) , and then again chancellor , as well ' ' Menxia Shilang ' ' ( ) , the deputy head of the examination bureau of government ( , ' ' Menxia Sheng ' ' ) . Later that year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Yang Sifu and Li Jue , whom he had stripped of chancellor posts and sent out of Chang'an because he believed that they did not support him as emperor , became further incensed by the powerful eunuch Qiu Shiliang against Yang and Li Jue , as well as two eunuchs trusted by Emperor Wenzong Liu Hongyi ( ) and Xue Jileng ( ) that he ordered Liu and Xue to commit suicide , and further sent eunuchs with orders to force Yang and Li Jue to commit suicide as well . After Du Cong pointed out to Li Deyu that it was unwise to let Emperor Wuzong to be accustomed to kill officials , Li Deyu , Chen , and fellow chancellors Cui Gong and Cui Dan interceded . As a result , Yang and Li Jue were spared of their lives , but further demoted . Chen was himself soon involved in a policy argument against Li Deyu , as Tang 's long-time ally and vassal Huigu had recently been defeated by Xiajiasi , and Huigu remnants were approaching Tang borders . One major group of Huigu remnants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tiande ( , in modern Bayan Nur , Inner Mongolia ) and sought food aid , offering to submit to Tang . The defender of Tiande , Tian Mou ( ) , suggested that Wamosi 's offer be rejected and that Tang forces attack him , along with allied Tuyuhun , Shatuo , and Dangxiang tribes . Li Deyu opined differently , believing that Wamosi 's offer should be accepted and that food should be supplied to the Huigu remnants . Chen opposed Li Deyu , arguing that in effect , it would be aiding the enemy . Emperor Wuzong eventually agreed with Li Deyu . In 842 , after Wamosi had made a trip to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wuzong , Chen was relieved of his chancellor post and made ' ' Zuo Pushe ' ' ( ) , one of the heads of the executive bureau ( , ' ' Shangshu Sheng ' ' ) . In 843 , Chen was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor ( ' ' Jiedushi ' ' ) of Hezhong Circuit ( , headquartered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality . He was also given the honorary title of acting ' ' Sikong ' ' ( , one of the Three Excellencies ) and ' ' Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ' ' . Troops under him subsequently participated in the campaign against the warlord Liu Zhen , which Li Deyu was overseeing . He died in 844 and was given posthumous honors. # Notes and references # * ' ' Book of Tang ' ' , vol. 173. * ' ' New Book of Tang ' ' , vol. 181. * ' ' Zizhi Tongjian ' ' , vols. 245 , 246 , 247.
