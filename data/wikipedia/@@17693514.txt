The Dcoration du Lys was a medal created by the Bourbon Restoration . # Background # From the end of 1813 , Napoleon 's armies were fighting on their own soil , culminating in the Six Days Campaign . Napoleon ended his reign with a series of Pyrrhic victories which could not save the Empire , and he abdicated on 5 April 1814 . In a Paris occupied by the forces of the Coalition , the National Guard ensured public order by wearing a white cockade , abandoning the Revolutionary tricolour cockade , and it was on this corps that the returning Bourbons chose to found their power , rather than the Imperial armies and their officers , which they judged still to be too unreliable. # Creation # King Louis XVIII arrived in Paris on 3 May with his brother Charles de Bourbon , Comte dArtois , the future Charles X. It was then that little medals with the image of the new king and fleurs de lys , on white ribbons , began to circulate to reassure and appease the Paris population . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1814 , created the Dcoration du Lys for the garde nationale of Paris as a perpetual sign of the services it has rendered , whether in fighting for their homes and , charged alone on the night of 30 March with ensuring Paris 's guard and safety , preserving the king 's capital for the king and the goods , lives and honour of so many families , or - when occupying posts beside those of the troops of the line - it rendered them an example of devotion and sacrifice , or when - despite this painful service - it acted as the maison militaire du Roi and granted the royal family the satisfaction of , for their guard , not being surrounded by the French . By an order of the day on 9 May 1814 , king Louis XVIII approved the creation of the Dcoration du Lys , extending it to all the gardes nationales of France . It was awarded to the national guards after they took the following oath - I swear fidelity to God , and to the King , forever The granting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent . Assuring the loyalty of the social elite to the new monarchy thanks to this simple honour , the award of the Dcoration du Lys would be extended again and again , quickly starting to be awarded in all France 's regions then royal officials granted them successively to generals , ministers , prefects , and finally even mayors . It was banned during the Hundred Days , then reinstated on the Second Restoration , only to be suppressed once and for all by an ordinance of Louis Philippe on 10 February 1831. # Beneficiaries # * Order of April 26 1814 : the Dcoration du Lys was to be granted solely to the troops of the national guard of Paris officers , sous-officiers , grenadiers or chasseurs who have justified their well-deserving them * Order of May 9 1814 : the granting of the Dcoration du Lys was extended to all the national guards of France . Then it was awarded equally to officials of various administrations , to notables , to deputation members , to high-level and general officers , etc. # Characteristics # # Ribbons # * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple white ribbon . * ' ' Ordinance of 9 May 1814 ' ' : white ribbon moir with a white rosette ; but to distinguish the garde nationale de Paris , the arms of Paris were embroidered or marked on the ribbon * ' ' Ordinance of 5 August 1814 ' ' : the ribbon of the Garde nationale de Paris became white with , along each side , a 2mm blue stripe. * ' ' Ordinance of 5 February 1816 ' ' : each of the gardes nationales dpartementales bore the Dcoration du Lys on a ribbon specific to its department , with only 12 of France 's 86 departments retaining the white ribbon . # Bars # * ' ' Ordinance of 9 May 1814 ' ' : for civil holders , the king authorised the wearing of a simple white ribbon , sometimes with a three-band bar , generally in silver but sometimes in gold , representing a reduction of the croix du Lys , or a lily ( often crowned and bordered by two olive branches ) As with the croix du Lys , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le Roi ' ' . These bars were sometimes borne on the ribbon of the Lgion dhonneur. # Insignia # * ' ' Ordinance of 26 April 1814 ' ' : a simple fleur de lys in silver . * ' ' Ordinance of 9 May 1814 ' ' : a silver fleur de lys from the royal crown . * ' ' Ruling of 31 August 1816 ' ' : after too many abuses of the insignia ( mostly eccentric ) , the count of Artois fixed the definitive rules for wearing the Dcoration du Lys. * ' ' 5 May 1824 ' ' : the grand chancellor of the Lgion dhonneur recalled that the Dcoration du Lys having furnished a pretext for a multitude of abuses , the king put its supervision under the grand chancellor . He therefore recalled that this decoration must only be a simple silver fleur de lys hung from a white ribbon or of the colours set out for each of the departments of the kingdom ( ... ) The mania for ribbons and decorations , the cupidity of some jewellers , fantasies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitating royal or foreign orders . It was ruled that each ribbon must be worn only for one department and the simple , long-established fleur de lys was to be the only one allowed ; all the others were abolished and must disappear . # Did an Ordre du Lys exist ? # The Dcoration du Lys was often called the Ordre du Lys . Even if from 1824 it was controlled by the grand chancellory of the Lgion dhonneur , it never had a Grand Master or a chancellory of its own , and is never called an Order in the official documents . # Dcoration de la Fidlit # In 1816 the 600 National Guards serving in Paris in 1815 received the Dcoration de la Fidlit , created by order of Louis XVIII on 5 February 1816 to replace the Dcoration du Lys . Strictly speaking , it was not a new decoration but mainly a particular version of the Dcoration du Lys , albeit one strictly reserved for thes 600 Guards . It was in gold , and not widely awarded .
