Squadron A refers to the historic cavalry unit of New York City 's Upper East Side . Squadron A originated with a group of wealthy young gentlemen with great interest in equestrian sport who formed themselves into a group called the ' New York Hussars . They adopted fancy blue uniforms and headgear for ceremonial purposes that mimicked Eurasian fashions dating back to the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars . In effort to become more professional and militarized , they extended membership to Captain Charles F. Roe , twenty-year veteran of the US Army Cavalry , who inspired its membership with the cavalry spirit and military discipline . His efforts were successful to the point that in 1889 fifty-three men were mustered into the New York State National Guard as Troop A , becoming the cavalry arm of the Empire State .
