Hebron is a Administrative divisions of New York#Town # Geography # Hebron 's beautiful hills and valleys are part of the slate valley of the Upper Taconic Mountains ( ' ' Taghkanic , ' ' meaning ' in the trees ' ) , and part of the Great Appalachian Valley ( also known simply as the ' Great Valley ' ) . Thus , many of the main hills , valleys , creeks and roads run diagonally across Hebron in keeping with the general outlay of the Appalachians . Hebron is notably at once a nexus between valley regions within the ' Great Valley ' , and also between mountain regions . The nexus of the Champlain and Hudson Valleys ( described in greater detail below in the paragraph on watersheds ) is located here . The taller peaks of the Taconics are on the Vermont side of the border , and begin to dwindle comparatively into foothills in Hebron . Hebron can be described as the foothills between the Adirondack Mountains of New York , and the Taconic and Green Mountains of Vermont . Hebron thus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lowlands dividing mountain areas . In an era of much water pollution , it is a good thing to be at the top end of watersheds . Hebron 's battles with water quality are internal rather than related to problems upstream . According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 56.4 sqmi , of which , 56.2 sqmi of it is land and 0.2 sqmi of it ( 0.32% ) is water . The east town line of Hebron is the Vermont Border , and the beginning of New England proper . The town of Salem is adjacent to the south . The towns of Argyle , Hartford and Granville ( famous for its colored slate ) make up the remaining border on western and northern edges . NY Route 22 is a north-south highway through the eastern part of the town , running roughly parallel to the Vermont border . Route 30 connects Salem to Hartford through the western part of Hebron . Route 31 , the longest road through Hebron , cuts across diagonally from Route 30 connecting West Hebron to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two major watersheds whose waters travel great distances in opposite directions , only to rejoin ultimately in the Atlantic Ocean . The formal valleys and watersheds to which Hebron belongs are the following : Champlain Valley / Lake George Watershed02010001 ; Hudson River Valley / Hudson-Hoosic Watershed02020003 . Waters in the northernmost part of Hebron drain via the Mettawee River north into Lake Champlain , where they mix with waters from Lake George ( ' ' Horican ' ' ) and then flow into the Saint Lawrence River ( ' ' Kaniatarowanenneh ' ' ) . These Hebron waters mingle in the Saint Lawrence with waters of all the Great Lakes as they flow northeast into the Gulf of St. Lawrence , and ultimately join the Atlantic Ocean . Meanwhile , the majority of Hebron waters drain south via Black Creek into the Batten Kill ( ' ' Dionondehowa ' ' ) and then the Hudson River ( ' ' Muh-he-kun-ne-tuk ' ' or Muhheakantuck ) , and flow south into the Atlantic Ocean just below New York City . The two branches of Black Creek join in West Hebron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the waterfall in the West Branch of Black Creek ( which is just before Patterson Road ) . See map .

Few soldiers settled in the area , and most of the land was acquired by land speculators . They sold off sold parcels to Yankee migrants and Scots-Irish immigrant settlers for farming . Some of the patents that form the town are Blundell and Sheriff . Originals of these patents are held by the National Archives . The town of Hebron was formed 23 March 1786 and was named by its Yankee settlers after Hebron , Connecticut . Its namesake is the biblical Hebron . This is the largest city in the present-day West Bank , 30 km south of Jerusalem . NY Route 22 , the main road on the east side of the town , began as The Great Northern Turnpike , chartered in 1799 . Two historic milepost markers remain in the town , one at 7047 State Route 22 , the second just north of Chamberlin Mills Road . A third is just south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A peddlers wagon belonging to Lorenzo Levi Brown of Hebron is in the wagon collection of the Museum of Long Island at Stony Brook , New York . The town developed as an agricultural community , which it still is today . By 1864 , it was the chief potato-producing area of Washington County . Potatoes have been superseded by dairy farming . In recent decades , farms have been consolidated into larger operations . While the town has numerous residents whose families have been in the area for three generations , it also has new part-time residents who have second homes here . Others have retired here for the beauty of the area . # Hebron Volunteer Fire Company # The West Hebron Volunteer Fire Company was formed in 1947 . Willard Bain , a charter member , died in February 2008 . The first fire truck , BRUSH 356 , was put into service in 1947 and operated until 2008 . It was retired after the purchase that spring of a CAFS truck ATTACK 356 .

David Getty , a lifelong resident of Hebron , is Fire Chief . # Hebron Preservation Society # The Hebron Preservation Society was chartered by the State of New York in 1975 . The Society maintains a museum , with collections held in two historic buildings located on the east side of Route 22 in the hamlet of East Hebron .

Coy ( E.L . Coy ) . Both Coy and Rachel Campbell of Hebron took credit for the discovery . The variety was a naturally fertilized seedling of Garnet Chili . The earliest published reference to the Beauty of Hebron variety is from the 1876 Annual Agricultural Society Meeting in Marblehead , Massachusetts . The next year , in 1877 the US Department of Agriculture USDA introduced the Beauty of Hebron potato to growers in 26 states for tests . Various major seed companies of the time claimed credit for its commercial introduction , including J. M. Thornburn of New York City , JJH Gregory of Marblehead , and Peter Henderson of New Jersey . In 1879 Coy shipped Hebron Beauties to London . The Beauty of Hebron was one of the varieties used to restock the British Isles after the potato blight and Irish Potato Famine . Its use spread throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Caledonia . By the turn of the 20th century , it was also a favorite of market and home gardeners in the United States . In 1946 , the USDA did not list it in commercial production in the United States , but the 1959 ' ' Potato Variety Handbook ' ' of the American Potato Association includes the Beauty of Hebron . Most current tissue culture stocks and tubers came from Elmer Hansen of Alberta , Canada ; in 1988 he provided seed to Will Bownall and the Seedsavers organization , devoted to preserving historic varieties . The Beauty of Hebron is listed on the RAFT list of Threatened American Foods . The Beauty of Hebron is maintained at the Canadian Potato Research Center in Fredericton , New Brunswick , Canada ; the University of North Dakota Potato Breeding Program ; and with a commercial breeder . As of 2008 , it was not known if the potato variety was in commercial production . Due to Sally Brillion of the Hebron Preservation Society , amateur gardeners began to cultivate the Beauty of Hebron potato in 2006. # Notable natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in Minerva , New York , he was a free black who had a farm in Hebron for a time .
