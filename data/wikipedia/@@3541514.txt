A corbel arch ( or corbeled / corbelled arch ) is an arch-like construction method that uses the architectural technique of corbeling to span a space or void in a structure , such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a bridge . A corbel vault uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building 's roof . A corbel arch is constructed by offsetting successive courses of stone ( or brick ) at the springline of the walls so that they project towards the archway 's center from each supporting side , until the courses meet at the apex of the archway ( often , the last gap is bridged with a flat stone ) . For a corbeled vault covering the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls . Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design , corbeled arches are not entirely self-supporting structures , and the corbeled arch is sometimes termed a false arch for this reason .

Corbel arches and Vault ( architecture ) # Use in historical cultures # # Ireland # The Newgrange passage tomb has an intact corbel arch ( vault ) supporting the roof of the main chamber , dating from about 3000BC. # Ancient Egypt # Egyptian pyramids from around the time of Sneferu used corbel vaults in some of their chambers .

The prevalence of this spanning technique for entrances and vaults in Maya architecture is attested at a great many Maya archaeological sites , and is known from structures dating back to the Formative or Preclassic era . By the beginning of the Classic era ( ca. 250 CE ) corbeled vaults are a near-universal feature of building construction in the central Petn Basin region of the central Maya lowlands . # India # Before the true arch was introduced by the Mughals , the arches in Indian buildings were trabeated or corbelled . In North India in the state of Orissa , the later temples at Bhubaneswar were built on the principle of corbelled vaulting , which is seen first in the porch of the Mukteswar a temple said to epitomize N. Indian architecture , circa 950 AD and , technically speaking , no fundamental change occurred from this time onwards .
