' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' ( English : ' ' On These Streets ' ' ) is a telenovela broadcast by Radio Caracas Televisin between 1992 and 1994 . It was extremely popular in Venezuela , due to its very realistic approach to the day-to-day life of the country and local tone . It was the first Venezuelan program to give a realistic view of the corruption in political life , as well as the first to show the day-to-day life in the poor ' ' barrios ' ' . For example , it showed the impact on poor people 's lives of the intermittent water supply , showing community meetings and lovers ' trysts cut short by the news that the water was on , sending everyone running to fill storage tanks and barrels .

The network decided to take the risk of making a story which took place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Por Estas Calles began as a traditional telenovela called Eva Marina . During the pre-production stage , however , the concept changed from a traditional romance to a more actual , street-related story . The original chapters were wiped and the history , now under its new name and concept , began its filming . The telenovela was initially written by Ibsen Martnez , but he resigned six months later . It is believed that RCTV demanded him not only an extension ( something very usual when a telenovela is very successful ) but also a better ending for characters who were very popular but morally questionable , something he was not willing to do . Despite his absence , the telenovela lasted for another year under a team of scriptwriters , and when it ended it was still popular . Por Estas Calles inspired a rival telenovela with similar themes , El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios , produced by Marte TV and broadcast by RCTV rival channel Venevisin .

At the beginning , the main story revolved around the tribulations of elementary teacher Eurdice Briceo , falsely accused of murder , who has to hide under a new identity . But the other characters soon took bigger screen time , and it became an ensemble story . During its runtime , ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' adapted many stories inspired by news headlines . One of the show 's characters , Don Chepe Orellana , bore a striking resemblance to former president Jaime Lusinchi , who in real life had of course been manipulated by Blanca Ibez . On the show , Don Chepe and his mistress Lucha pocketed public money with one sleight-of-hand move after another , doled out favors to campaign contributors , developed all kinds of illegal schemes to hold on to power , and ruthlessly eliminated political enemies . # Characters # The cast was one of the greatest and most memorable in the entire history of Venezuelan telenovelas .
