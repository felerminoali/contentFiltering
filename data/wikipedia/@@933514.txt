He was appointed by General Wavell in the spring of 1943 to raise 111th Indian Brigade as a second Chindit Brigade . Because Wingate was in Burma conducting the Chindit operation ( Operation ' ' Longcloth ' ' ) , he was unable to influence the choice . Wingate 's dislike of Indian Army officers and in particular officers of Gurkha battalions also worked against Lentaigne . He objected to the appointment after he learned of it but was unable to do anything about . On Wingate 's death , Lentaigne took over command of the Chindit organization . He was the seniormost officer in the Chindits and also had the most command experience . General Slim described the problems involved in replacing Wingate within the Chindits : ' To step into Wingate 's place would be no easy task . His successor had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who had shared their hardships and in whose skill and in whose skill and courage they could trust ' . Again . British Commanders states the inevitable choice for the new chief of the Chindits was Major General Lentaigne . He was one of Wingate 's closest disciples and a veteran of the Burma fighting . Amongst his rivals for the position including Mike Calvert and Derek Tulloch there was criticism of this decision . They alleged that Lentaigne was the Chindit leader least in tune with Wingate 's methods and tactics . They also pointed out that he had commanded 111 Indian Brigade in the field for only a few weeks . After the war , certain of his rivals used the comments of his Brigade Major John Masters with regard to Lentaigne 's age out of context to attack him . Lentaigne had been a distinguished battalion commander who had fought during the 1942 Burma campaign . The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities lacking Staff College qualifications or significant time in command of even a battalion-sized formation . Additionally , there was no clear successor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that they would have been ( or were ) Wingate 's obvious successor . Field Marshal Lord Slim wrote in his memoirs of the Burma War , Defeat into Victory , that after Wingate 's death , at least three officers went to him , and told him , separately and confidentially , that Wingate had designated each of them as the divisional commander , in the event of his death . # Postwar career # In his book ' ' Red Coats to Olive Green ' ' , Colonel V Longer has listed Lentaigne as one of the handful of British general officers to be offered attachment to , and service in , the post-independence Indian Army . Among the others were General Sir Rob Lockhart , Lt-Gen Sir Dudley Russell , and Maj-Gen H Williams , who , as engineer-in-chief , was the last to retire , late in 1955 . He was acting Director Military Operations but was eased out as he proposed a 25-mile border corridor in Punjab under British troops to save innocent people . ( Ref .

He retired in 1955 and died soon after returning to London .
