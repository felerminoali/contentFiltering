Halomethane compounds are derivatives of methane ( CH  4  ) with one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced with halogen atoms ( F , Cl , Br , or I ) . Halomethanes are both naturally occurring , especially in marine environments , and man-made , most notably as refrigerants , solvents , propellants , and fumigants . Many , including the chlorofluorocarbons , have attracted wide attention because they become active when exposed to ultraviolet light found at high altitudes and destroy the Earth 's protective ozone layer . # Structure and properties # Like methane itself , halomethanes are tetrahedral molecules . The halogen atoms differ greatly in size and charge from hydrogen and from each other . Consequently , the various halomethanes deviate from the perfect tetrahedral symmetry of methane . The physical properties of the halomethanes are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the halogen atoms . In general , they are volatile but less so than methane because of the polarizability of the halides . The polarizability of the halides and the polarity of the molecules makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flammable than methane . Broadly speaking , reactivity of the compounds is greatest for the iodides and lowest for the fluorides. # Production # # Industrial routes # The halomethanes are produced on a massive scale from abundant precursors , i.e. natural gas or methanol , and from halogens or halides . They are usually prepared by one of three methods . *Free radical chlorination of methane : : CH  4  + Cl  2  ( + UV ) CH  3  Cl + HCl This method is useful for the production of CH  4-x  Cl  x  ( x = 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 ) . The main problems with this method are that it cogenerates HCl and it produces mixtures of different products . *Halogenation of methanol . This method is used for the production of the mono-chloride , -bromide , and -iodide . : CH  3  OH + HCl CH  3  Cl + H  2  O : 4 CH  3  OH + 3 Br  2  + S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  SO  4  + 2 HBr : 3 CH  3  OH + 3 I  2  + P 3 CH  3  I + HPO(OH)  2  + 3 HI *Halogen exchange . The method is mainly used to produce fluorinated derivatives from the chlorides . : HCCl  3  + 2 HF HCF  2  Cl + 2 HCl Traces of halomethanes in the atmosphere arise through the introduction of other non-natural , industrial materials . # In nature # Many marine organisms biosynthesize halomethanes , especially bromine-containing compounds . Small amounts of chloromethanes arise from the interaction of chlorine sources with various carbon compounds . The biosyntheses of these halomethanes are catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase enzymes , respectively . An idealized equation is : : CH  4  + Cl  -  + 1/2 O  2  CH  3  Cl + OH  -  # Classes of compounds # Halons are usually defined as hydrocarbons where the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by bromine , along with other halogens . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but simpler than ) the system used for freons . The first digit specifies the number of carbon atoms in the molecule , the second is the number of fluorine atoms , the third is the chlorine atoms , and the fourth is the number of bromine atoms . If the number includes a fifth digit , the fifth number indicates the number of iodine atoms ( though iodine in halon is rare ) . Any bonds not taken up by halogen atoms are then allocated to hydrogen atoms . For example , consider Halon 1211 : C F Cl Br 1 2 1 1 Halon 1211 has one carbon atom , two fluorine atoms , one chlorine atom and one bromine atom . A single carbon only has four bonds , all of which are taken by the halogen atoms , so there is no hydrogen . Thus its formula is CF  2   BrCl  , and its IUPAC name is therefore **26;40726;TOOLONG # ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34-1992 # The refrigerant naming system is mainly used for fluorinated and chlorinated short alkanes used as refrigerants . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34-1992 , with additional annual supplements . The specified ANSI/ASHRAE prefixes were FC ( fluorocarbon ) or R ( refrigerant ) , but today most are prefixed by a more specific classification : * CFC list of chlorofluorocarbons * HCFC list of hydrochlorofluorocarbons * HFC list of hydrofluorocarbons * FC list of fluorocarbons * PFC list of perfluorocarbons ( completely fluorinated ) The decoding system for CFC-01234a is : *0 = Number of double bonds ( omitted if zero ) *1 = Carbon atoms -1 ( omitted if zero ) *2 = Hydrogen atoms +1 *3 = Fluorine atoms *4 = Replaced by Bromine ( B prefix added ) *a = Letter added to identify isomers , the normal isomer in any number has the smallest mass difference on each carbon , and a , b , or c are added as the masses diverge from normal . Other coding systems are in use as well . # Hydrofluoro compounds ( HFC ) # Hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) contain no chlorine . They are composed entirely of carbon , hydrogen , and fluorine . They have no known effects on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HFCs and perfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) are greenhouse gases , which cause global warming . Two groups of haloalkanes , hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) and perfluorocarbons , are targets of the Kyoto Protocol . Allan Thornton , President of the Environmental Investigation Agency , a non-governmental , environmental watchdog , says that HFCs are up to 12,500 times as potent as carbon dioxide in global warming . Wealthy countries are clamping down on these gases . Thornton says that many countries are needlessly producing these chemicals just to get the carbon credits . Thus , as a result of carbon trading rules under the Kyoto Protocol , nearly half the credits from developing countries are from HFCs , with China scoring billions of dollars from catching and destroying HFCs that would be in the atmosphere as industrial byproducts. # Overview of principal halomethanes # Every permutation of hydrogen , fluorine , chlorine , bromine , and iodine on one carbon atom has been evaluated experimentally . # Applications # Because they have many applications and are easily prepared , halomethanes have been of intense commercial interest . # Solvents # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low flammability , and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes this colorless liquid a useful solvent . It is widely used as a paint stripper and a degreaser . In the food industry , it is used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavorings . Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams . # Propellants # One major use of CFCs has been as propellants of aerosols , including metered-dose inhalers for drugs used to treat asthma . The conversion of these devices and treatments from CFC to propellants that do not have the same effect on the ozone layer is almost complete . Production and import is now banned in the U.S. # Fire extinguishing # At high temperatures , halons decompose to release halogen atoms that combine readily with active hydrogen atoms , quenching flame propagation reactions even when adequate fuel , oxygen , and heat remain . The chemical reaction in a flame proceeds as a free radical chain reaction ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to halt the fire at much lower concentrations than are required by fire suppressants using the more traditional methods of cooling , oxygen deprivation , or fuel dilution . For example , Halon 1301 total flooding systems are typically used at concentrations no higher than 7% by volume in air , and can suppress many fires at 2.9% v/v . By contrast , carbon dioxide fire suppression flood systems operate from 34% concentration by volume ( surface-only combustion of liquid fuels ) up to 75% ( dust traps ) . Carbon dioxide can cause severe distress at concentrations of 36% , and has caused death by respiratory paralysis in a few minutes at 10% concentration . Halon 1301 causes only slight giddiness at its effective concentration of 5% , and even at 15% those exposed remain conscious but impaired and suffer no long term effects . ( Experimental animals have also been exposed to 2% concentrations of Halon 1301 for 30 hours per week for 4 months , with no discernible health effects . ) Halon 1211 also has low toxicity , although it is more toxic than Halon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , Halon 1301 fire suppression is not completely non-toxic ; very high temperature flame , or contact with red-hot metal , can cause decomposition of Halon 1301 to toxic byproducts . The presence of such byproducts is readily detected because they include hydrobromic acid and hydrofluoric acid , which are intensely irritating . Halons are very effective on Class A ( organic solids ) , B ( flammable liquids and gases ) and C ( electrical ) fires , but they are unsuitable for Class D ( metal ) fires , as they will not only produce toxic gas and fail to halt the fire , but in some cases pose a risk of explosion . Halons can be used on Class K ( kitchen oils and greases ) fires , but offer no advantages over specialised foams . Halon 1301 is common in total flooding systems . In these systems , banks of halon cylinders are kept pressurised to about 4 MPa ( 600 psi ) with compressed nitrogen , and a fixed piping network leads to the protected enclosure . On triggering , the entire measured contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds , through nozzles designed to ensure uniform mixing throughout the room . The quantity dumped is pre-calculated to achieve the desired concentration , typically 37% v/v . This level is maintained for some time , typically with a minimum of ten minutes and sometimes up to a twenty minute soak time , to ensure all items have cooled so reignition is unlikely to occur , then the air in the enclosure is purged , generally via a fixed purge system that is activated by the proper authorities . During this time the enclosure may be entered by persons wearing SCBA . ( There exists a common myth that this is because halon is highly toxic ; in fact , it is because it can cause giddiness and mildly impaired perception , and also due to the risk of combustion byproducts . ) Flooding systems may be manually operated or automatically triggered by a VESDA or other automatic detection system . In the latter case , a warning siren and strobe lamp will first be activated for a few seconds to warn personnel to evacuate the area . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air with fog , and is accompanied by a loud , disorienting noise . Due to environmental concerns , alternatives are being deployed . Halon 1301 is also used in the F-16 fighter to prevent the fuel vapors in the fuel tanks from becoming explosive ; when the aircraft enters an area with the possibility of attack , Halon 1301 is injected into the fuel tanks for one-time use . Due to environmental concerns , trifluoroiodomethane ( CF  3  I ) is being considered as an alternative . Halon 1211 is typically used in hand-held extinguishers , in which a stream of liquid halon is directed at a smaller fire by a user . The stream evaporates under reduced pressure , producing strong local cooling , as well as a high concentration of halon in the immediate vicinity of the fire . In this mode , fire is extinguished by cooling and oxygen deprivation at the core of the fire , as well as radical quenching over a larger area . After fire suppression , the halon diffuses , leaving no residue . # Chemical building blocks # Chloromethane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesis . Chlorodifluoromethane is the main precursor of tetrafluoroethylene , which is the monomeric precursor to Teflon. # Safety # Haloalkanes are diverse in their properties , making generalizations difficult . Few are acutely toxic , but many pose risks from prolonged exposure . Some problematic aspects include carcinogenicity ( e.g. , methyl iodide ) and liver damage ( e.g. , carbon tetrachloride ) . Under certain combustion conditions , chloromethanes convert to phosgene , which is highly toxic .
