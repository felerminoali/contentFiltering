' ' Dance of the Tiger ' ' is a short novel , published in English in 1980 , by palaeontologist Bjrn Kurtn that deals with the interaction between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons . Set 35,000 years ago in Scandinavia , during a thaw in the great Ice Age , the novel follows a Cro-Magnon named Tiger as he tries to defeat Shelk , a tyrant and a hybrid ( Neanderthal-Cro-Magnon ) , the man who killed his father . With his family and much of his tribe dead , Tiger meets , interacts , and allies himself with groups of Neanderthals . He eventually marries a Neanderthal woman . A sequel , Singletusk , published in 1982 , continues the story of the family . Neanderthals are depicted as white-skinned , while Cro-Magnons are dark . Kurtn 's skin color identification for both populations appears to agree with recent DNA studies , including those proposing the African origin of modern humans . His racial presentation of the Cro-Magnon is in contrast to Jean M. Auel 's view in her Earth 's Children series . Auel 's initial book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger , portrayed Neanderthals as light-skinned and Cro-Magnons as more racially varied , either light or dark-skinned . The author himself says ' ' The book is not intended to be a ' theory about interaction between Neanderthals and Modern Humans ' , it is just a fictive description of one possible scenario among several that  might  have taken place ' ' . Kurtn was n't the first novelist to examine the subject , for instance author William Golding also examined the issue of Neanderthal extinction in ' ' The Inheritors ' ' . Cro-Magnon children and adults are portrayed as having smooth brows and small faces ; the characteristic features of childhood act as innate releasing mechanisms for feelings of affection . : ' ' To the Whites , the Blacks were godlike , tall and eloquent , with a speech as varied and flexible as that of the birds . And there was something else . No White could look at the clear brow of a Black without feeling a mysterious tenderness , such as a child might evoke in the heart of his parents . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperback ) Kurtn postulates that this attraction led to intermarriage between the two people , which produced sterile offspring . He emphasizes the possibility of Neanderthal extinction through inter-breeding rather than through violence . He also presents social differences between the two groups , presenting the Cro-Magnon people as more aggressive , practicing slavery and choosing violence to solve social problems . The Neanderthal society , based on a matriarchal system , is drawn as peace loving with elaborate social rituals designed to resolve problems . The novel is known for its plausibility and accuracy . Kurtn 's supposition that Neanderthals and ancestors of modern ' ' Homo sapiens ' ' occupied same areas in the same time in Europe has been confirmed by fossil evidence . : ' ' Kurtn has managed to insinuate into his story - in a way so subtle and natural that we can scarcely recognize he is teaching as well as novelizing - every fact and theory that I know ( and several , undoubtedly , that I do n't ) about Neanderthals , Cro-Magnons , human evolution during the Ice Age , glacial geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals , including mammoths and saber-toothed tigers .
