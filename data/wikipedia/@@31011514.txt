During the time they were in Costa Rica , they recorded thirteen to fourteen songs for the album . The song , Take Her From You , was composed while in Costa Rica recording the album .

Ben Norman from About.com gave to the album three stars out of five , summarizing that Dev 's debut album is at least little more than pandering to the mainstream . There are some interesting tracks that give us flashes of insight into the minds creating the works . Whether the credit goes to Dev or to her producers is uncertain but almost irrelevant , as long as you enjoy it . That being said , The Night The Sun Came Up is well-crafted , quality dance/pop . If Dev achieves another hit from it , I 'll be shocked .

Elysa Gardner from USA Today wrote that on the album her fresh , lissome vocals are actually more intriguing than the textural , tonal and rhythmic shifts that pop up in the sometimes sweetly groovy but mostly unremarkable tunes . Music rating website ' ' Musicovered ' ' gave the album three out of ten stars , stating the album comes short of expectations and that the production was sloppy , with many of the album 's tracks sounding the same .

He adds that the album fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapping style , comparing it to that of Swedish recording artist Robyn , and the song In the Dark for blending European dance music with flourishes of Latin and Mediterranean music . Neil Miller , Jr . of UR Chicago rated the album two out of five stars ( on the site , they use meatballs ) , calling it one of the most unbalanced pop records ever released . Idolator however claims that to peg Dev as a Kesha clone is dangerous as she has a greater air of mystery than Kesha and the positive review ends with for those out there who like the soundtrack to their late-night fiesta to come with a bit more subtlety . # Commercial performance # In the United States , ' ' The Night The Sun Came Up ' ' debuted on the ' ' Billboard ' ' 200 chart on the week of April 14 , 2012 at number sixty one with 6,700 copies sold . # Singles # The debut single off the album is Bass Down Low , which was produced by and features The Cataracs .
