This article is about the administrative divisions of Lithuania . # Grand Duchy of Lithuania ( 12511569 ) # In the earliest stages of the formation of the Lithuanian state , there had been several lands ( Lithuanian : plural ' ' ems ' ' , singular ' ' em ' ' ) , such as Nalia , Deltuva and Lietuva , as well as others . They were ruled by regional dukes . When King Mindaugas ( 12511263 ) unified the state , he killed , expelled , or subjugated most of the regional dukes . The lands were either added to ruler 's domain or granted to members of his family . As the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expended into Slavic lands , the title to the acquired principalities was given to the Grand Duke 's offspring or his other relatives . For example , Mindaugas granted Black Ruthenia with center in Navahrudak to his son Vaivilkas ; Gediminas sent his brother Fiodor to Kiev . This system had major disadvantages , for the principalities remained semi-independent with loose ties to the central government . Rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a situation that led to frequent power struggles . In early 15th century Vytautas the Great initiated administrative reforms . He replaced regional dukes and princes with trustworthy nobles who depended on the favor of the Grand Duke . This marked the rise of Lithuanian nobility . In 1413 Union of Horodo was signed ; Vilnius and Trakai Voivodeships were created in ethnic Lithuanian lands , copying the Polish system . The Eldership of Samogitia had a special semi-autonomous status . Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political , social , administrative features . They were only slowly incorporated into administration of the Grand Duchy . The Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471 , other five voivodeships were established between 1504 and 1514 . The Smolensk Voivodeship , the largest of all , was established in 1508 , but was lost to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1514 . Voivodeships ( Lithuanian : plural ' ' vaivadijos ' ' , singular ' ' vaivadija ' ' ) , ruled by appointed officials voivodes , were further subdivided into powiats ( Lithuanian : plural ' ' pavietai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major administrative reforms took place in 15641566 in preparation for the second Statute of Lithuania and the overhaul of judicial system . The entire territory of the Grand Duchy , with exception of Samogitia , was divided into 12 voivodeships. # Grand Duchy of Lithuania ( 15691795 ) # Just before the Union of Lublin ( 1569 ) , the four voivodeships of ( Kiev , Podlaskie , Bracaw , and Woy ) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the Polish Crown by direct order of Sigismund II Augustus while the Duchy of Livonia , acquired in 1561 , became a condominium ( joint domain ) of both Lithuania and Poland . This left Lithuania with eight voivodeships and one eldership : After the Livonian War ( 15581582 ) , Lithuania acquired the vassal state of Duchy of Courland with its capital Jelgava . This administrative division remained without any major changes until the partitions of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth in late 18th century . # Russian Empire ( 17951914 ) # Under the Russian Empire , the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lithuanian : ' ' gubernija ' ' ) and districts ( Russian : ' ' uyezd ' ' , Lithuanian : ' ' apskritis ' ' ) . Such system was introducing in Russia during the reforms of 1775 . The first governorates , Vilna Governorate ( consisting of eleven districts ) and Slonim Governorate , were established after the third partition of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth . Just a year later , on December 12 , 1796 , they were merged into one governorate , called Lithuania Governorate , with capital in Vilnius . In 1801 Lithuania Governorate was split into Lithuania-Vilna Governorate and Lithuania-Grodno Governorate . Forty years later the word Lithuania was dropped from the two names and official maps of Europe . The territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania became known as the Northwestern Krai . In 1843 another administrative reform took place , creating Kovno Governorate out of seven western districts of the Vilna Governorate . Vilna Governorate received three additional districts : Vileyka and Dzisna from Minsk Governorate and Lida from Grodno Governorate . In 1837 Augustw Governorate was established in the territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Russia . Lithuanian Suvalkija was included into this governorate . After the January Uprising , Augustw Governorate was split into Suwaki Governorate and oma Governorate ( see Administrative division of Congress Poland ) . This way most of the present-day territory of Lithuania fell into three governorates ( Vilna , Kovno , and Suwaki ) . Two more governorates included some small Lithuanian territories . In 1819 a narrow coastal strip with Palanga and ventoji was transferred to the Courland Governorate . This territory was acquired from Latvia after an international arbitration in 1920 . Small areas in northernmost Grodno Governorate were given to Lithuania after it joined the Soviet Union in 1940 . In 1861 , after announcing the abolition of serfdom , peasants acquired civil rights , among them a right to self-governmence . To facilitate such a right townships ( Russian : ' ' volost ' ' , Lithuanian : ' ' valsius ' ' ) and elderates ( Russian : ' ' mir ' ' , Lithuanian : ' ' seninija ' ' ) were established . By the end of 1861 there were 1,479 elderates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 153 townships of Kovno Governorate . The elderates would elect an elder ( Russian : ' ' starosta ' ' , Lithuanian : ' ' seninas ' ' ) and representatives to a township council ( Lithuanian : ' ' valsiaus sueiga ' ' ) . However , these institutions had very little power and were dependent on the local nobles . The power was concentrated in the hands of governors , all of whom were appointed by the tsar . # Interwar ( 19181940 ) # During the interwar , Lithuania regained independence . The first law on administrative sub-units was passed on July 1 , 1919 . It declared that Lithuania was divided into twenty counties ( Lithuanian : singular ' ' apskritis ' ' , plural ' ' apskritys ' ' ) . Several more counties ( including Zarasai , Naujieji venionys , Vilnius , Eiiks , Lida , Ashmyany and Hrodna ) were reserved for territories in the Vilnius Region , that Lithuania had claims to , but were under Polish or Russian control . Later on Suwaki county was lost to Poland , but Zarasai ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the designated counties , Trakai and Sejny , had their proclaimed capitals outside the ' ' de facto ' ' borders of Lithuania and had their temporary capitals established at Kaiiadorys and Lazdijai . After the Klaipda Region was acquired in 1923 , it was divided into three counties ( Klaipda , ilut and Paggiai ) . That way the number of counties increased to twenty three and remained stable until 1939 . According to a law passed in 1931 eleven first-class cities became independent of county administration and had their own government . In March 1939 , after an ultimatum from Hitler , Lithuania lost the Klaipda Region with its three counties . In October Soviet Union returned one fifth of the Vilnius Region in exchange for Red Army stations in Lithuania . Acquired Vilnius Region was divided into three counties ( Vilnius , Eiiks , and Naujieji venionys ) . Therefore , at the end of 1939 Lithuania again had twenty three counties . Counties were further subdivided into townships ( Lithuanian : singular ' ' valsius ' ' , plural ' ' valsiai ' ' ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further subdivided into elderates ( Lithuanian : ' ' seninija ' ' ) . The counties were governed by a county governor ( Lithuanian : ' ' apskrities virininkas ' ' ) , appointed by the Minister of Interior . Being almost the only link between the central government and the local population , governors were first responsible for a wide range of duties . They were to collect all property left by the retreating German army , organize local government , recruit local army groups , ensure security and stability in the county , etc . In 1920 they were also entrusted to preside over county police . In 1931 , in an effort to centralize the government , county governors also became the chairmen of a three-member county governing body ( Lithuanian : ' ' apskrities valdyba ' ' ) , an executive institution of a county council . That way power in a county became centralized in the hands of a governor . County councils ( Lithuanian : ' ' apskrities taryba ' ' ) were elected by local population for a three-year term .

These were the counties , their territory and residents according to the 1923 census : # Soviet system ( 19401994 ) # Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union on June 15 , 1940 . However due to ensuring World War II the authorities did not introduce major changes to the administrative divisions , just elderates were renamed to ' ' apylink ' ' . After the second occupation in 1944 , the number of counties grew from 26 to 41 : eleven counties were added in 194647 and four more were introduced in 1949 . At the end of 1947 there were 37 counties subdivided into 320 townships that were further subdivided into approximately 2,900 apylinks . The entire interwar system was scraped for the 10th anniversary of the first occupation . The new system matched that of other Soviet Republics . On July 20 , 1950 Lithuanian SSR was divided into four provinces ( Russian : ' ' oblast ' ' , Lithuanian : ' ' sritis ' ' ) . The provinces were further subdivided into 87 districts ( Russian : ' ' raion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Kaunas Province with 23 districts , Klaipda Province with 16 districts , iauliai Province with 24 districts , and Vilnius Province with 24 districts . The townships were abolished and the districts were further subdivided into apylinks . In 1984 there were 527 apylinks in Lithuania . Both provinces and districts were named after their capitals . Three exceptions were : Smliai district had its capital in Ukmerg ( also capital of Ukmerg district ) , Panemun district capital Garliava , and Klaipda district capital Gargdai . In addition to districts , there were five ( Vilnius , Kaunas , Klaipda , iauliai , and Panevys ) province-administered cities ( Lithuanian : ' ' srities pavaldumo miestas ' ' ) . They had similar rights as a district . The provinces were short-lived and on May 28 , 1953 they were abolished , leaving the districts as the first-level administrative division . The number of districts was reduced several times , and in 1962 it settled at 44 . The province-administered cities were renamed to ' ' republic-administered cities ' ' ( Lithuanian : ' ' respublikinio pavaldumo miestas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eleven in 1979 . These cities became the city municipalities after the reform in 1994. # Division until dissolution of counties in 2010 ( 19942010 ) # : ' ' See : Counties of Lithuania , Municipalities of Lithuania , Elderships ' ' . The administrative division into 10 counties was created in 1994 , modified in 2000 . The first level administration was dissolved in 2010 Lithuania was divided into : *10 counties ( Lithuanian : plural ' ' apskritys ' ' , singular ' ' apskritis ' ' ) , each named after their principal city ( see : Counties of Lithuania ) . These ' ' apskritys ' ' should not be confused with ' ' apskritys ' ' that existed in the interwar period . *the counties are subdivided into 60 municipalities ( Lithuanian : plural ' ' savivaldybs ' ' , singular ' ' savivaldyb ' ' ) . There are three types of municipalities : **43 district municipalities ( Lithuanian : ' ' rajono savivaldyb ' ' ) . They roughly correspond to districts that existed under the Soviet rule . Before 1994 they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as districts . The word municipality was added in effort to diminish the Soviet heritage ( districts were created as raions throughout the Soviet Union ) ; **7 city municipalities ( Lithuanian : ' ' miesto savivaldyb ' ' ) . They are situated around major or important cities . In common language they are referred to as just cities or as just municipalities ( because word municipality in Lithuanian language is associated more with cities and city rights than with districts ) ; **10 municipalities . They were all established after 1994 and they do not have the word district associated with them . *municipalities consist of over 500 elderships ( Lithuanian : plural ' ' seninijos ' ' , singular ' ' seninija ' ' ) . Each municipality 's government is elected in democratic elections of municipality councils . The elections used to take place every three years , but now they are held every four years . The municipality mayors are elected by municipality councils . Also , municipality councils appoint elders to be in charge of an eldership . Currently it is proposed that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counties were ruled by ' ' apskrities virininkas ' ' ( officially translated as governor ) who was appointed by the central government in Vilnius . Their primary duty was to ensure that the municipalities obey the laws of Lithuania and the constitution . They did not have great powers vested in them , and so it was suggested that 10 counties are too much for Lithuania ( the smallest county has only four municipalities ) . It was proposed to replace the counties with four or five ' ' lands ' ' , a new administrative unit , that would be decided according to the ethnographic regions of Lithuania and based on the five major cities . On 1 July 2010 , the county administrations were abolished , and since that date , counties remains as the territorial and statistical units . # Comparison of post-1918 systems #
