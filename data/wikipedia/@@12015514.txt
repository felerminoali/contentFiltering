' ' Teases &amp; Dares ' ' is the fourth studio album by Kim Wilde , released in November 1984 via MCA Records . # Background # After leaving RAK Records , who had released her first three albums , Wilde signed to MCA Records in 1984 . Her brother , Ricky Wilde , continued to serve as her producer , though was now assisted by their father , Marty Wilde , who also continued to co-write material . For the first time , Kim Wilde also received a co-producer credit and the album also marked the first time in which she earned a sole songwriting credit , for the tracks Fit In and Shangri-la . Three singles were taken from the album . The Second Time reached the UK Top 30 and the Top 10 in Germany , as well as becoming only her second single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100 , where it was retitled Go For It and peaked at No. 65 . The second single from the album , The Touch was less successful but the third single , Rage to Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK Top 20 for the first time in three years . # Image change # Prompted by her new record company , Wilde underwent a change of image for ' ' Teases &amp; Dares ' ' and found herself being recast in an entirely new light . She changed from a girl wearing secondhand clothes with self-dyed hair , to a Barbarella-inspired sci-fi heroine ( by XL Design ) for the cover of The Second Time . Though initially only for the single , MCA Records decided to use the new image for the album cover also , which Wilde objected to . She later cited the album sleeve as one of the reasons for its weak sales , stating that it confused her audience who still regarded her as the girl-next-door . For subsequent single releases from the album , Wilde switched back to an image she felt more identifiable with . For the Rage to Love promotion , she wore one of her father 's Teddy Boy jackets ; in keeping with the rockabilly retro theme of the song . # Critical response # ' ' Billboard ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge and described the sound as somewhere between Sheena Easton and Debbie Harry . ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' described the randy lyrics for The Second Time written by Wilde 's brother and father as somewhat perverse and found her too bland and docile a singer to generate much heat or to enliven Ricki 's stale wall-of-synths production . However , the reviewer reserved praise for Kim 's self-written efforts , writing that Fit In and Shangri-La have the passive , yearning tone of a jailhouse diary and expressed hope that the vivacious , earnest singer might be smart enough to cut loose her puppet strings . . # Track listing # All tracks written by Ricki Wilde/Marty Wilde , unless otherwise noted . # The Touch 4:13 # Is It Over 3:56 # Suburbs of Moscow 3:24 # Fit In ( Kim Wilde ) 4:38 # Rage to Love 4:20 # The Second Time 3:54 # Bladerunner 4:29 # Janine 3:47 # Shangri-La ( Kim Wilde ) 4:49 # Thought It Was Goodbye ( Kim Wilde , Ricki Wilde , Marty Wilde ) 4:38 Is It Over is featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2010 Remastered CD Edition ) # # Lovers on a Beach ( The Second Time B-side ) # Shangri-La ( Alternative Version ) # Putty in Your Hands ( Rage to Love B-side ) # Turn It On ( from Weird Science Soundtrack ) # The Second Time ( 7 Version ) # The Touch ( 7 Version ) # Rage to Love ( 7 Version ) # Bonus CD ( 2010 Remastered CD Edition ) # # The Second Time ( 12 Version ) # Lovers on a Beach ( 12 Version ) # Go For It ( Extended Dance Version ) # The Touch ( 12 Version ) # Shangri-La ( 12 Version ) # Go For It ( Dub Version ) # Rage To Love ( 12 Version ) # Shangri-La ( Special Re-Mix ) # The Second Time ( US Remix ) # Personnel # *Kim Wilde vocals , arranger , producer , solina , dx-7 , mini-moog , Roland System 700m , Roland Jupiter 8 , Polyfusion Modular system , Emu Emulator II , Fairlight CMI , Buchla Series 200 , Memorymoog , Oberheim ob-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arranger , backing vocals *Ricki Wilde producer , bass , harmonica , arranger , programming , backing vocals , synclavier , solina , dx-7 , jupiter 8 , mini-moog , fender jazz bass , guitar *Steve Byrd guitar , backing vocals *Andy Duncan percussion *Christopher North drums *Nigel Mills engineer *Gary Twigg bass *John Shaw photography # Chart performance # # Album # ' ' Teases &amp; Dares ' ' spent only two weeks in the UK Albums Chart , entering at number 66 for the week-ending 17 November 1984 , and falling to number 79 the week after .
