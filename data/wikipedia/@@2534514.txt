It follows the character of Toloki . After finding himself destitute , he invents a profession as a Professional Mourner . He traverses the violent urban landscape of an unnamed South African city , finding an old love amidst the internecine fighting present in the townships and squatter settlements . ' ' The Heart of Redness ' ' , Mda 's third novel , is inspired by the history of Nongqawuse , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Xhosa culture split between Believers and Unbelievers , adding to existing social strain , famine and social breakdown . It is believed that 20,000 people died of starvation during that time .
