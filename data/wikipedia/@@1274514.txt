Sir William Scroggs ( c. 1623 &amp;ndash ; 25 October 1683 ) , Lord Chief Justice of England , was the son of an Oxford landowner ; an account of him being the son of a butcher of sufficient means to give his son a university education is merely a rumour . # Youth and early career # Scroggs spent his youth in Stifford . He went to Oriel College , and later to Pembroke College , Oxford , where he graduated in 1640 , having acquired a fair knowledge of the classics . There is some evidence that he fought on the royalist side during the Civil War . In 1653 he was called to the bar , and soon gained a good practice in the courts . He was appointed a judge of the Common Pleas in 1676 , and two years later was promoted to be Lord Chief Justice . # Lord Chief Justice and the Popish Plot # As Lord Chief Justice Scroggs presided at the trial of the persons denounced by Titus Oates for complicity in the Popish Plot , and he treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sarcasm and abuse while on their trial , and taunting them when sentencing them to death . So careless was he of the rights of the accused that at one trial he admitted to the jury that he had forgotten much of the evidence . He may at first have been a sincere believer in the existence of the Plot , along with much of the general public and Parliament , but he did nothing to test the credibility of witnesses like Oates , William Bedloe , Miles Prance and Thomas Dangerfield , even though he knew well that Bedloe and Dangerfield were leading figures in the criminal underworld , and he probably also knew that Prance had made his confession under threat of torture . In November 1678 William Staley , a young Catholic banker , was executed for treason in that he had imagined ( i.e. threatened ) the King 's death . Staley , a heavy drinker , had probably made a threat against the King when drunk , but in less disturbed times he could have hoped to escape with a severe reprimand . Scroggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man 's life he would have no regard paid to the rumours of the time but the rest of his summing up was wholly in favour of a guilty verdict . A week later Edward Colman , former private secretary to the Duke of York , was executed for allegedly treasonable correspondence with Louis XIV of France . Again Scroggs drove hard for a conviction despite Colman 's standing as a Government official . Colman 's letters in which he urged Louis to press Charles II for a dissolution of Parliament , showed a grave lack of political judgement , but it was straining the law to call them treasonable . The correspondence , which apparently ended in 1674 , had no effect on English policy , and was of such little importance that Colman until he was confronted with the letters had apparently forgotten writing them . Scroggs told Colman that he had been condemned on his own papers ; this was fortunate for the Crown , since the evidence of Oates and Bedloe of overt acts of treason was so feeble that Scroggs in his summing-up simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoners Henry Berry , Robert Green , and Lawrence Hill , accused of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey , Scroggs gave a characteristic exhibition of his methods , indulging in a tirade against the Roman Catholic religion , and loudly proclaiming his belief in the guilt of the accused . When Lawrence Hill 's wife boldly accused Miles Prance , the Crown 's chief witness , of perjury in open court , Scroggs said incredulously You can not think that he will swear three men out of their lives for nothing ? . All three defendants were put to death . As Mrs. Hill correctly predicted , Prance later confessed that the three were wholly innocent . It was only when , in July of the same year , Oates 's accusation against the Queen 's physician , Sir George Wakeman , appeared likely to involve the Queen herself in the ramifications of the plot , that Scroggs began to think matters were going too far ; he was probably also influenced by the discovery that the court regarded the plot with discredit and disfavour , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had supposed with the King . The Chief Justice on this occasion threw doubt on the trustworthiness of Bedloe and Oates as witnesses , and warned the jury to be careful in accepting their evidence . Wakeman and a number of priests who were tried with him were duly acquitted . This inflamed public opinion against Scroggs , for the popular belief in the plot was still strong . Scroggs continued in his poor treatment of Catholic priests who came before him for trial , as he showed when he sentenced Andrew Bromwich to death at Stafford in the summer of 1679 . Nevertheless his proposing the Duke of York 's health at the Lord Mayor 's dinner a few months later , in the presence of Shaftesbury , indicated his determination not to support the Exclusionists against the known wishes of the king . At the opening of the Michaelmas Term he delivered a speech on the need for judicial independence : the people ought to be pleased with public justice and not justice seek to please the people .. justice must flow like a mighty river .. neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupted an age that no man can with safety be just and follow his own conscience . Kenyon remarks that whatever Scroggs 's faults , this speech shows that he was far more than the brainless bully he is sometimes portrayed as . Acting in the assurance of popular sympathy , Oates and Bedloe now arraigned the Chief Justice before the Privy Council for having discredited their evidence and misdirected the jury in the Wakeman case , accusing him at the same time of several other misdemeanours on the bench , including a habit of excessive drinking and foul language . In January 1680 the case was argued before the Council and Scroggs was acquitted . At the trials of Elizabeth Cellier and of Lord Castlemaine in June of the same year , both of whom were acquitted , he discredited Dangerfield 's evidence , and on the former occasion committed the witness to prison . In the same month he discharged the grand jury of Middlesex before the end of term in order to save the Duke of York from indictment as a popish recusant , a proceeding which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made an article in the impeachment of Scroggs in January 1681 . The dissolution of Parliament put an end to the impeachment , but in April Scroggs was removed from the bench with a pension ; he died in London on 25 October 1683. # Personality and lifestyle # Scroggs was a judge at a time when the courts were considered corrupt and unfair and his temper and treatment of defendants were an example of the endemic problems within the judiciary . He served on the bench during the same period as Judge Jeffreys who has also been criticised for similarly poor treatment of defendants and witnesses . Kenyon notes that while their behaviour was degrading and disgusting by modern standards it was at the time apparently taken for granted . Scroggs was the subject of many contemporary satires ; he was reputed to live a debauched lifestyle and his manners during trials were considered ' coarse ' and ' violent ' . Roger North , who knew him well , described him as a man of great wit and fluency , but scandalous , violent , intemperate and extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his celebrated attack on William Whitshed , Lord Chief Justice of Ireland , called him as vile and profligate a villain as Scroggs . # Legal writings # Scroggs was the author of a work on the Practice of Courts-Leet and Courts-Baron ( London , 1701 ) , and he edited reports of the state trials over which he presided . # Authorities # *William Cobbett , ' ' Complete Collection of State Trials ' ' ( vols. i. -x . of State Trials , 33 vols , London , 1809 ) *Roger North , ' ' Life of Lord Guilford ' ' , etc. , edited by A Jessopp ( 3 vols , London , 1890 ) , and Examen ( London , 1740 ) *Narcissus Luttrell , ' ' A Brief Relation of State Affairs , 1678-1714 ' ' ( 6 vols , Oxford , 1857 ) *Anthony Wood , ' ' Athenae Oxonienses ' ' , edited by P Bliss ( 4 vols , London , 18131820 ) * , edited by Edward Maunde Thompson ( 2 vols , Camden Society 22 , 23 , London , 1878 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justices of England ' ' ( 3 vols , London , 18491857 ) *Edward Foss , ' ' The Judges of England ' ' ( 9 vols , London , 18481864 ) *Sir JF Stephen , ' ' History of the Criminal Law of England ' ' ( 3 vols , London , 1883 ) *Harry Brodribb Irving , ( London , 1898 ) . *John Philipps Kenyon ' ' The Popish Plot ' ' Phoenix Press Reissue
