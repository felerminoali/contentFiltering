Evelyn McDonnell of ' ' Spin ' ' said that the idol America loves to hate went all out .

Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years , Spears is now desperately seeking our attention . And she earns it . Haters go home . Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center ... was the old , fun-loving , free-wheeling Spears with a sexy , showgirl twist . There was n't much pretense , though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible . Instead , there was just good dance music . Carla Meyer of ' ' The Sacramento Bee ' ' stated that Though Spears performed like a pro throughout the show , hitting all her marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first stop on a tour . But that hesitancy vanished when she put on the denim . She seemed at ease . Shaunna Murphy of ' ' Entertainment Weekly ' ' criticized Britney 's complete lack of verbal audience interaction ... and her obviously diminished dancing ability but also added that with her slim waist , her dangerously toned legs , and most importantly her engaged , wide-eyed smile , Spears looked happy to be there with usthe crucial element that has been missing from so many Britney shows of late . August Brown of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' stated that the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing or at least tweaking the past . ... Spears manipulates pops virgin-whore complex better than just about anyone , and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of ' Do nt Let Me Be the Last to Know ' ... felt true to the sweep of her career she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club 's heat or into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' commented , Though visually impressive , the show lacked a truly engaging human quality . Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment , lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself . With her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks , she appeared onstage as some strange blend of Michael Jackson , Madonna and Kraftwerk 's Ralf and Florian . However , ' ' Jam ! Canoe ' ' considered the show best described as Janet Jackson-like . Steve Palopoli of ' ' Metro Silicon Valley ' ' said , Musically , the show is heavy on the hits , although considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna 's albums is best . She 's a cultural phenomenon , obviously , and the only edicts that seem to have been handed down in regards to the music is ' no lip-synching ' ( she definitely does n't ) and ' bigger and louder whenever possible . ' Shirley Halperin of ' ' The Hollywood Reporter ' ' stated it was entertaining , but Spears does nt quite have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits . Jim Harrington of the ' ' Oakland Tribune ' ' deemed the show as a mess pretty much from start to finish . The theatrics are awkward and confusing , the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat , the song selection is weak and misguided , and Britney 's star power , so blinding on tours past , is remarkably dim . Alexis Petridis of ' ' The Guardian ' ' gave the show two stars out of five , saying that there 's a suspicion that the kind of person who goes to see Britney Spears live is n't really there for the music or her sparkling personality : tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever . What they 're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity . Neil McCormick of ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' gave the show one star out of five , and called it the saddest , laziest , dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed . He added that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , having forked out around 50 a head for tickets , practically raised the roof , cheering every dismal dance move , roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica . # Commercial reception # Live Nation announced in early May 2011 a partnership with deal-of-the-day website Groupon . A spokesperson explained , Offering a deal on Groupon is not a reflection of the quality or status or sales of a show but rather segmented marketing and a way to reach new and additional consumers . A staff editor for VH1 noted that as of June 16 , 2011 , 18,000 tickets were sold at discounted prices through Groupon for fifteen of the first twenty-four dates of the tour , including 1,800 at opening night in Sacramento . The Groupon deals for shows in Seattle , Winnipeg , Saint Paul , and Atlanta actually expired before all available discounted tickets were sold . The editor also stated that the shows look to be under-attended in smaller cities , even as , in metropolitan areas like Greater New York City , new shows have been added . It remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better price optimization , or whether the tours ambition was more outsized than its actual draw .
