Fashion in 15th-century Europe was characterized by a series of extremes and extravagances , from the voluminous gowns called houppelandes with their sweeping floor-length sleeves to the revealing doublets and hose of Renaissance Italy . Hats , hoods , and other headdresses assumed increasing importance , and were swagged , draped , jewelled , and feathered . As Europe continued to grow more prosperous , the urban middle classes , skilled workers , began to wear more complex clothes that followed , at a distance , the fashions set by the elites . It is in this time period that we begin to see fashion take on a temporal aspect . People could now be dated by their clothes , and being in out of date clothing became a new social concern . National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the 15th century . # General trends # # Dominance of the Burgundian court # With England and France mired in the Hundred Years War and its aftermath and then the English Wars of the Roses through most of the 15th century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering court of the Duchy of Burgundy , especially under the fashion-conscious power-broker Philip the Good ( ruled 14191469 ) . Having added Holland and Flanders to their dominion , the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest fabrics of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of Bruges and Antwerp . Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins Giovanni Arnolfini amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure . Especially in Florence , where sumptuary laws prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city 's fortunes were built , the materials of men 's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings , but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very fine grade . # Fabrics and furs 1400-1500 # Wool was the most popular fabric for all classes by far , followed by linen and hemp . Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities , from rough undyed cloth to fine , dense broadcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe . Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours , notably reds , greens , golds , and blues , although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad ( and less frequently indigo ) could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the ' ' Trs Riches Heures du duc de Berry ' ' . Silk-weaving was well established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the 15th century , and figured silks , often silk velvets with silver-gilt wefts , are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the wealthy throughout Europe . Stately floral designs featuring a pomegranate or artichoke motif had reached Europe from China in the 14th century and became a dominant design in the Ottoman silk-producing cities of Istanbul and Bursa , and spread to silk weavers in Florence , Genoa , Venice , Valencia and Seville in this period . Fur was worn , mostly as a lining layer , by those who could afford it . The grey and white squirrel furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of style except at court , first for men and then for women ; the new fashionable furs were dark brown sable and marten . Toward the end of the 15th century , wild animal furs such as lynx became popular . Ermine remained the prerogative and hallmark of royalty . # Slashing # Slashing is a decorative technique that involved making small cuts on the outer fabric of a garment in order to reveal the inner garment or lining . It was performed on all varieties of clothing both men 's and women 's . This practice , revealed brightly colored pieces of fabric from underneath an outer garment . Contemporary chroniclers identify the source of the fashion for slashing garments to the actions of Swiss soldiers in the aftermath of the Battle of Grandson in 1476 . Supposedly the Swiss plundered the rich fabrics of the Burgundian nobles and used the scraps to patch their tattered clothes . In reality , images appear of sleeves with a single slashed opening as early as mid-15th century , although the German fashion for many small all-over slits may have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashings spread to German Landsknechts and thence to France , Italy , and England , where it was to remain a potent current in fashionable attire into the mid-17th century . A second result of the defeat at Grandson was the decline of Burgundy as a fount of culture and fashion . The heiress Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian I , Holy Roman Emperor but died young . In the last decade of the 15th century , Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and was briefly declared King of Naples . As a result , the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy , which would combine with German influence to dominate fashion in France ( and later , England ) in the first half of the 16th century . # Women 's fashion # # Gown , kirtle , and chemise # Women 's fashions of the 15th century consisted of a long gown , usually with sleeves , worn over a kirtle or undergown , with a linen chemise or smock worn next to the skin . The sleeves were made detachable and were heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly , often confined by a belt . The wide , shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck , often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath . Various styles of overgowns were worn . The ' ' cotehardie ' ' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores . It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ' ' tippets ' ' . The tight fit was achieved with lacing or buttons . This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande , a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-15th century . The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist , making a full bag sleeve . The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through . Around 1450 , the dress of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer linen partlet . Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining , frequently of fur or black velvet , and the sleeves might be cuffed to match . Sleeves were very long , covering half of the hand , and often highly decorated with embroidery . Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another . The term ' ' robe dguise ' ' was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions , a term which endured into the 1500s . In Italy , the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-15th century . This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ' ' gamurra ' ' ( sometimes spelled ' ' camorra ' ' ) . Sleeveless overgowns such as the ' ' cioppa ' ' were popular , and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks . A lighter-weight undergown for summer wear was the ' ' cotta ' ' . A sideless overgown called the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the end of the period , sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed , allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm , at the shoulder , and at the elbow . This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries . The ' ' partlet ' ' , a separate item to fill in a low neckline , appeared in this period , usually of sheer fabric ( linen or possibly silk ) with an open V-neckline . Some partlets have a collar and a back similar to the upper part of a shirt . Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the dress ( but over the kirtle ) ; in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the gown and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front . Two uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s . The ' ' verdugada ' ' or ' ' verdugado ' ' was a gown with a bell-shaped hoop skirt with visible casings stiffened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depictions of this garment come from Catalonia , where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style , a chemise with trumpet sleeves , open and very wide at the wrist . The sideless surcoat of the 14th century became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty , usually with an ermine front panel ( called a ' ' plackard ' ' or ' ' placket ' ' ) and a mantle draped from the shoulders ; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as shorthand to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period . # Hairstyles and headdresses # A variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century . The ' ' crespine ' ' of Northern Europe , originally a thick hairnet or snood , had evolved into a mesh of jeweler 's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the 14th century . Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed , like horns ( ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was pulled back from the forehead , and the crespine , now usually called a ' ' caul ' ' , sat on the back of the head . Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows . Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll , sometimes arranged in a heart-shape , or a veil , or both . Veils were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead . Women also wore the chaperon , a draped hat based on the hood and liripipe , and a variety of related draped and wrapped turbans . The most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the hennin , a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a floating veil . Later hennins feature a turned-back brim , or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim . Towards the end of the 15th century women 's head-dresses became smaller , more convenient , and less picturesque . The gable hood , a stiff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder ladies up until the mid 1500s . Women of the merchant classes in Northern Europe wore modified versions of courtly hairtyles , with coifs or caps , veils , and wimples of crisp linen ( often with visible creases from ironing and folding ) . A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil ; this style is sometimes known by the German name ' ' kruseler ' ' . The general European convention of completely covering married women 's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy . Italian women wore their hair very long , wound with ribbons or braided , and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free . The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps . Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears ( a style that would inspire vintage hair fashions in the 1620s and ' 30s and again in the 1840s and 1850s ) . Blond hair was considered desirable ( by Botticelli for one ) , and visitors to Venice reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats , attempting to bleach it in the sun . Chemical methods were also used . # Women 's footwear # Women from the 14th century wore laced ankle-boots , which were often lined with fur . Later in the 15th century , women also wore poulaines . They used pattens to protect their tight shoes . # Style gallery Northern Europe 1400s1440s #  Image:Christine de Pisan and her son.jpg1 141011 Image:Christine de Pisan and Queen Isabeau detail.jpg2 141011 Image:Franko-flmischer Meister 002. jpg3 c. 1410 Image:Rogier van der Weyden 029. jpg4 1430 Image:Eyck magarete.jpg5 1439 Image:Van der Weyden Crucifixion Triptych.jpg6 1443 Image:Rogier van der Weyden- Seven Sacraments Altarpiece - Baptism , Confirmation , and Penance ; detail , baptism.jpg7 144550 Image:Isabella of portugal.jpg8 144550 Image:MargaretAnjou.jpg9 14451450  #Image of Christine de Pisan in a cotehardie .

Linen shirts were worn next to the skin . Toward the end of the period , shirts ( French ' ' chemise ' ' , Italian ' ' camicia ' ' , Spanish ' ' camisa ' ' ) began to be full through the body and sleeves with wide , low necklines ; the sleeves were pulled through the slashings or piecing of the doublet sleeves to make puffs , especially at the elbow and the back of the arm . As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric , wealthy men 's shirts were often decorated with embroidery or applied braid . Over the shirt was worn a doublet . From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets , belted or tailored to be tight at the waist , giving in effect a short skirt below , were fashionable , at least for the young . Sleeves were generally full , even puffy , and when worn with a large chaperon , the look was extremely stylish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist , and a chunky , solid one above . The doublet was often elaborately pleated , especially at the back , the pleats being achieved by various means . In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high , tight and collarless at the front of the neck ; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back . Men of all classes wore short ' ' braies ' ' or breeches , a loose undergarment , usually made of linen , which was held up by a belt . Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs , and were generally brightly colored . Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots . Hose were generally tied to the breech belt , or to the breeches themselves , or to a doublet . As doublets became shorter , hose reached to the waist rather than the hips , and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by short tops were , especially in Italy late in the 15th century , often strikingly patterned , parti-coloured ( different colours for each leg , or vertically divided ) , or embroidered . Hose were cut on the cross-grain or bias for stretch . # Overgowns and outerwear # The Houppelande , in Italy called the ' ' cioppa ' ' , is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century . It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with , at the start of the 16th century , a high collar . The houppelande could be lined in fur , and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops . It was initially often worn belted , but later mostly hanging straight . The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period . The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full , forming a bag or sack sleeve , or were worn off the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called a ' ' giornea ' ' in Italy and a ' ' journade ' ' in France , was popular . It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted . Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length . The middle of the 15th century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black , which was to reappear so strongly in the Spanish style of the mid-16th17th century and again in the 19th20th centuries . This was apparently begun by Duke Philip the Good . In Venice , the patrician class , after the age of joining the Great Council , wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the 15th century . In contrast , the young men and the famous courtesans of the city dressed very extravagantly . In the last decades of the 15th century , a new style of overgown appeared ; this was of various lengths , generally worn unbelted , and featured wide turned back revers and collar . Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions and in bad weather ; these typically fastened on one shoulder . # Headgear # Early in the 15th century , the hood remained a common component of dress for all classes , although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into the fantastical shapes of the chaperon . Hats of various styles -- tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all , hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif , or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front -- began to compete with the draped chaperon , especially in Italy . A brimless scarlet cap became nearly universal for young Florentines in particular , and was widely worn by older men and those in other cities . In mid-15th century , a bowl haircut with the hair shaved at the back of the neck was stylish . In Germany , and briefly in Venice , a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers ( and angels ) in the later part of the 15th centuryless often in portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair became fashionable , a trend that would continue into the early 16th century . **24;18874;br # Style gallery 14001450 #  Image:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg1 140510 Image:John the Fearless D of Burgundy.jpg2 140019 Image:Masaccio 032. jpg3 c. 1425 Image:Jan van Eyck 091. jpg4 1433 **32;18900;TOOLONG c.1435 Image:Chausses 1440 Cleeves.jpg6 1440 Image:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n4 detail.jpg7 1442 Image:Van der weyden miniature detail Philip.jpg8 14478  #The lord on the left wears a long figured houppelande with full sleeves lined in fur , while the men of his household wear short solid-coloured overgowns with parti-coloured or matching hose .
