The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad was the first railroad to cross Missouri starting in Hannibal in the northeast and going to St. Joseph , Missouri , in the northwest . It is said to have carried the first letter to the Pony Express on April 3 , 1860 , from a train pulled behind the locomotive ' ' Missouri ' ' . The line connected the second and third largest cities in the state of Missouri prior to the American Civil War . The stage route that it paralleled previously been called the Hound Dog Trail . # History # # Construction in 1850s # Construction on the railroad ( formed during an 1846 meeting at the Hannibal office of John Marshall Clemens , father of Mark Twain ) began in 1851 from both cities . Bonds from counties along the route along with the donation of 600,000 acres ( 2,400 km ) in land voted by Congress paid for construction . The lines met in Chillicothe , Missouri , on February 13 , 1859 . A marker the railroad placed at the site was discovered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Galesburg , Illinois . The line started westward from Hannibal and ran through the Missouri cities of Palmyra , Monroe City , Shelbina , Clarence , Anabel , Macon , Bevier , Callao , New Cambria , Bucklin , Brookfield , Laclede , Meadville , Wheeling , Chillicothe , Mooresville , Breckenridge , Nettleton , Hamilton , Kidder , Cameron , Osborn , Stewartsville , Hemple , Easton , before arriving in St. Joseph . John Rogers , well before he became a popular 19th-century American sculptor , worked in 1856 and 1857 as a mechanic on the railroad . Abraham Lincoln rode the route in 1859 en route to a speech in Council Bluffs , Iowa . The first assignment of Col. Ulysses S. Grant during the American Civil War was protecting the railroad and Pony Express mail . Grant was promoted to brigadier general in August 1861 after the assignment . Shortly after Grant left his assignment , the railroad experienced its worst disaster of the war on September 3 , 1861 , when bushwhackers burned a bridge over the Platte River , causing a derailment that killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge Railroad Tragedy . # Post offices on wheels , 1860s # The first experiment in distributing mails in so-called post offices on wheels was made in 1862 by William A. Davis between Hannibal and St. Joseph , Missouri . It was intended to expedite the connection at St. Joseph with the overland stage , which had replaced the Pony Express routes to the West a year earlier . The H&amp;StJ furnished a baggage car , altered to Davis ' specifications . Similar to a postal route agent 's car , it had a table and a 65-pigeon-hole letter case , but no pouch rack . Davis boarded the westbound train at Palmyra , Missouri , with authority to open the sacks and letter packages which were addressed to the St. Joseph DPO , to remove all California letters , and to make up and sort the mail in a manner identical to the way the St. Joseph DPO would have dispatched it . Davis was paid at the rate of $100.00 per month . The railroad was harassed by guerrillas and by lack of maintenance , resulting in several suspensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , Railway Post Office ( RPO ) service was re-established on this line , and it became known as the Chicago &amp; Kansas City RPO . In 1867 a consortium of Charles E. Kearney , Robert T. Van Horn , and Kersey Coates persuaded the railroad to build a cutoff at Cameron to Kansas City , Missouri . The railroad , through its subsidiary Kansas City and Cameron Railroad , built a shortcut and the ( 1371ft m Hannibal Bridge over the Missouri River in downtown Kansas City . The bridge established a direct link between Chicago and Texas . It was the first rail bridge across the Missouri River when it opened July 3 , 1869 , and established Kansas City rather than Leavenworth or St. Joseph as the dominant city in the region . # Acquisition by Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad # The Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad used the railroad for through traffic to Chicago almost from the start , and in 1883 acquired it . The rail connection between Hannibal and St. Joseph remained in place for about 125 years . On March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burlington Northern after the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad merged with 3 other railroads to form the new company . During the mid-1980s , the railroad discontinued service from Brookfield westward to St. Joseph . Today , four miles ( 6 km ) of track between Brookfield and Laclede remain , and is primarily used for surplus rail car storage on the ( now ) BNSF Railway . The tracks from Laclede westward to St. Joseph no longer remain , while the tracks from Brookfield eastward toward the Mississippi River remain in use by the BNSF. # References
