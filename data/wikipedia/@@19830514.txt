Cardiff Docks is a port in southern Cardiff , Wales . At its peak , the port was one of the largest dock systems in the world with a total quayage of almost 11km mi . Once the main port for the export of South Wales coal , the Port of Cardiff remains active in the import and export of containers , steel , forest products and dry and liquid bulks. # History # Following the development of the coal found in the Cynon and Rhondda valley 's and Merthyr area of South Wales , the export of both coal and iron products required a sea connection to the Bristol Channel if economic volumes of product were to be created . In 1794 , the Glamorganshire Canal was completed , linking the then small town of Cardiff with Merthyr , and in 1798 a basin was built , connecting the canal to the sea . By the 1830s , Cardiff became the pre-eminent iron-exporting port , shipping almost half of British overseas iron exports ; between 1840 and 1870 , the volume of coal exports increased from 44,350 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation for proper dock facilities led Cardiff 's foremost landowner , John Crichton-Stuart , 2nd Marquess of Bute , to promote the construction of the ( West ) Bute Dock , designed by Admiral William Henry Smyth and opened in October 1839 . Just two years later , the Taff Vale Railway was opened , following much the same route as the canal . With the construction of the new East Bute Dock from 1855 , designed by James Walker of Messrs . Walker &amp; Burges and built by Thomas Cubitt 's firm , its opening in 1859 resulted in coal supplanting iron as the industrial foundation of South Wales , with exports reaching 2 million tons as early as 1862. # Queen Alexandra Dock # Frustration at the lack of development at Cardiff led to rival docks being opened at Penarth in 1865 and Barry , Wales in 1889 . These developments eventually spurred Cardiff into action , with the opening of the Roath Dock in 1887 , and the Queen Alexandra Dock in 1907 . By then , coal exports from the South Wales Coalfield via Cardiff totalled nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the holds of locally-owned tramp steamers . By 1913 , this had risen to 10,700,000 tons , making Cardiff the biggest coal exporting dock in the world . # Shipping # Cardiff 's first steamship was the Llandaff of 1865 , and by 1910 , there were some 250 tramp steamers owned at Cardiff , by prominent firms such as William Cory &amp; Son , Morel , Evan Thomas Radcliffe , Tatem and Reardon-Smith . Each day , the principals of these companies would meet to arrange cargoes of coal for their ships in the opulent Coal Exchange in Mount Stuart Square . This trade reached its pinnacle in 1913 , when 10.7 million tons of coal were exported from the port . After the First World War , there was a boom in shipping in Cardiff , with 122 shipping companies in existence in 1920 . The boom proved short-lived , however ; oil was growing in importance as a maritime fuel , and the terms of the Treaty of Versailles soon flooded Europe with cheap German reparation coal . # Railways # The Taff Vale Railway was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks . Its headquarters were a currently derelict building in Cardiff Bay railway station . The building was turned into a railway heritage centre in 1979 by the Butetown Historic Railway Society . By 1994 the Society had started to run steam locomotive hauled passenger services up and down 500 metres of track . However , as the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had no interest in the railway , the Society changed its name to the Vale of Glamorgan Railway and moved from the site in 1997 to Barry Island railway station . # Decline # From 1910 onwards capacity issues meant that the more modern and less tidal Barry Docks took over as the largest volume export point of coal . Until the early 1920s , Cardiff docks continued to boom as a location for shipping companies , but the fall in demand for Welsh coal caused a dramatic fall in exports . By 1932 , in the depths of the Great Depression which followed the General Strike in 1926 , coal exports had fallen to below 5 million tonnes and dozens of locally owned ships were laid-up . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attentions of the Nazi German Luftwaffe during the Cardiff Blitz , coal exports continued to decline , finally ceasing in 1964 . In 1950 , imports outstripped exports for the first time in the port 's history . The 1970s saw a short-term import boom , and in the 1980s the port experienced a slight rise in traffic , while much of the former port area began to be regenerated into non-port uses . The port found a niche as an important local centre for general cargo operations . # Modern Port Facilities # Cardiff now has three operational docks capable of handling ships of up to 35,000 tons deadweight . The port has transit sheds with 258500m2 sqft of storage space , two overland distribution sheds totalling 13870m2 sqft , and two timber sheds totalling 13870m2 sqft , two specialist steel sheds , with overhead gantry cranes , totalling 15000m2 sqft . There are 9 quayside cranes plus a range of mobile cranes . Cardiff 's specialised facilities include a distribution terminal and chill and cold storage for perishables. # Tiger Bay # Tiger Bay was a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase deriving from the area 's rough-and-tumble reputation . Merchant seamen arrived in Cardiff from all over the world , only staying for as long as it took to discharge and reload their ships : consequently many murders and lesser crimes went unsolved and unpunished , the perpetrators having sailed for other ports . In Victorian times , the name Tiger Bay was used in popular literature and slang ( especially that of sailors ) to denote any dock or seaside neighborhood which shared a similar notoriety for danger . # Cardiff Bay # The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was created in 1987 to counter the effects of economic depression in this run-down area . Today , the port of Cardiff and what is now known as Cardiff Bay has been totally transformed by the Cardiff Barrage that impounds the Rivers Taff and the Ely to create a massive fresh-water lake across to Penarth Head . Only two docks , the Roath and the Queen Alexandra , remain in use , and just two shipping companies remain , albeit buoyant with their worldwide interests .
