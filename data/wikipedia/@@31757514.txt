Under the pretext of land acquisition , the action was read as having gathered pace as after other legislative elections . The ' ' Times of India ' ' read the move as a bigger favour from jittery chief minister Mayawati and that the subsequent free-for-all included INC staging anti-Mayawati protests as well as BJP leaders trying not to be undone by also courting trouble on the basis of land-related strife everywhere ... giving politicians scope for photo ops .
