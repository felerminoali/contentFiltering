The Mauritius national rugby union team represents Mauritius in international rugby union . Mauritius is a member of the International Rugby Board ( IRB ) , but the national team is ranked as third tier , and Mauritius have yet to compete in either the Africa Cup or Rugby World Cup . Rugby Union Mauritius represents Mauritius internationally and is member of CAR ( Confederation Africaine de Rugby ) , AROI ( Association de Rugby Ocean Indien ) , IRB ( International Rugby Board ) and FIT ( Federation of International Touch ) . # History # Introduced by the English Army ( Colonial Time 1810 to 1968 Independence ) Rugby started in the early 1900s in Mauritius . The game was then introduced to the Franco-Mauritians by a group of rugby players who created the Dodo Club in 1928 which enhanced the start of Rugby competition on the island . From 1928 to 1975 rugby was played at senior level between various clubs remembered as the Buffalos , HMS Mauritius , Blue Ducks , Dodo , the Navy , SMF and the Stags . Stags and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closure of the Stags in 1982 . The Dodo Club remained the only active club which carried on developing the passion and culture of this sport , but unfortunately due to the retreat of the Dodo Club in all sports at national level , there was a need to phase out rugby from this club in order to develop the sport at a regional level . During these times , many youngsters went to boarding schools in South-Africa and England . Others went to university in South-Africa , England , France and Australia , and when they came back to Mauritius on holidays , there was a need to play rugby and show their friends that they did not only study overseas . This created an enthusiastic rugby atmosphere which led to traditional games between The Students and local players . Between 1992 and 2001 various tours were organised to Reunion Island participating to seven a side tournaments and XV rugby . We participated in the Kenya Safaris Sevens in 1996 and 1997 . In 1995 , during the third rugby World Cup in South Africa , six games were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of the Mauritian Seven a side Tournament with 4 Teams . In 1997 we started a development program in schools which led to the creation of three coaching centres in different parts of the island in 2003 . In 1998 , the Stags Club was re-created and thus triggered the thought that rugby had a place in the Mauritian Sport and the potential needed to be exploited . Mauritius rugby needed to be given a chance and the means for development at a national level . After three years of competition with clubs from surrounding countries and more players getting attracted by the rugby fever leading to an increasing demand for the creation of new clubs , three new regions/clubs were created in 2001 : The Curepipe Starlights , the Northern Pirates and the Western Cowboys . Today we have 4 Clubs in Division A and 6 Clubs in Division B , 3 Coaching Centres , around 650 licensed members , 18 Coaches , 6 Referees , National Sides in Senior ( 7 's &amp; XV ) Under 18 ( 7 's ) .
