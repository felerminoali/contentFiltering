The desert monitor , ' ' Varanus griseus ' ' , is a species of monitor lizards of the order Squamata found living throughout North Africa and South Asia . Three subspecies have been described : * ' ' V. g. griseus ' ' ( grey monitor ) * ' ' V. g. caspius ' ' ( Caspian monitor ) * ' ' V. g. koniecznyi ' ' ( Indian desert monitor ) The desert monitor is carnivorous , feeding on a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. # Description # # Body features # ' ' Varanus griseus ' ' monitor lizards normally display a variety of body coloration from light brown and yellow to grey . They average about one meter in length , but can reach total body lengths of almost two meters . These lizards can also have horizontal bands on either their backs or tails , along with yellow spots across their backs . Their young are normally a brightly colored orange and have distinctive bands across their backs which may be lost as they mature . Their nostrils are slits located farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose ) , and their overall body size is dependent on the available food supply , the time of year , environmental climate , and reproductive state . Males are generally larger and more robust than females , but females have a more gentle look about them . Those differences allow males to be distinguished from females from a distance without careful inspection . Adult monitor lizards also go through periods of molting in which they shed their outer layer of skin to expand their overall body size . This process can take several months and happens around three times per year . Their skin is adapted to the desert environment where they live , and they are excellent swimmers and divers and have been known to enter the water occasionally to hunt for food . # Subspecies # # # ' ' Varanus griseus griseus ' ' # # The ' ' V. g. griseus ' ' subspecies ( grey monitor ) has five to eight narrow grey bands on its back , as well as 19-28 bands on its tail . Its tail is more rounded that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adult depends on which habitat they are living . Their coloration can be from simple grey ( in desert-like ecosystems ) to brilliantly colored ( in areas with large amounts of plant growth ) . Their most common prey is lizards and snakes , but can also include ground-nesting birds and other small mammals . # # ' ' Varanus griseus caspius ' ' # # The ' ' V. g. caspius ' ' subspecies ( Caspian monitor ) has five to eight bands on its back , 13-19 bands on its tail , a plain tail tip , and about 143 rows of scales in the middle section of its body . It has the largest body of the three subspecies , and is considered to be in danger of becoming extinct . They are found in mainly sandy or clay environments , although sporadically in sparsely woodland areas . Their diets include tortoises and their eggs , small mammals , and adult cobras and vipers . They are strong diggers and can easily build burrows that are several feet long . # # ' ' Varanus griseus koniecznyi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' subspecies ( Indian desert monitor ) has three to five bands on its back , 13-19 bands on its tail , a plain tail tip , 108-139 rows of scales on its midsection , and a broader and flatter head when compared to the other subspecies . It is mainly found in Pakistan and India , and has the smallest body of the three subspecies . They have been reported to possibly not go through the normal hibernation period over the winter , but are still inactive and do not feed between December and March . Their normal diets consist mainly of invertebrates , but can also branch out to other lizards and small mammals . # Lifestyle # ' ' V. griseus ' ' goes into hibernation from about September to April . In April is a mass exodus from their hibernation , and they become most active between May and July . During the middle of the day , the lizards mainly stay in their burrows and only come to the desert surface to search for food . The monitor lizards require approximately three to four full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about 5565 cm excluding their tails ) and at least three hibernation periods before they become sexually mature . The overall lifespan of ' ' V. griseus ' ' in the wild does not normally exceed around eight years in both males and females . # #Importance of body temperature# # ' ' V. griseus ' ' is a cold-blooded ectotherm whose behaviors therefore depend on the outside temperatures . Many lizards become sluggish in cold weather and even may become inactive if the temperature decreases substantially . Their olfactory and nerve signals significantly slow down , which severely limit the lizard from either catching potential prey or escaping from predators . The body temperature of ' ' V. griseus ' ' is directly proportional to its running speed between the temperatures of 21 and 37 C. Between those temperatures , the running speed of the monitor lizard increases from a little over 1 m/s at 21 C to around 3 m/s at 37 C. Over 37 C , its running speed does not increase , and below 21 C , the lizards are extremely sluggish . If they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 21 C , they will not flee , but will instead hold their ground and become extremely aggressive . The more their body temperatures drop , the more aggressive the lizards become . In contrast , they can easily run away from the threat if their body temperatures are high enough to allow for rapid movements . The body temperature of ' ' V. griseus ' ' depends mainly on the outside environment ( time of day , season , etc . ) . Their internal temperatures begin warming up before they even leave their burrows through conductive heat gain , and their temperatures rapidly rise once they begin basking in the morning sun and reach their highest point in the noonday heat . The specific body temperature of ' ' V. griseus ' ' can vary depending on the average temperatures of the country they live in , but their maximum body temperature does not usually exceed 38.5 C even when basking in the sunlight . Male monitor lizards are generally more active and have a higher average body temperature than the females . The body temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in many areas , the average body temperature during hibernation is around 16-18 C. # Reproduction # Desert monitor reproduction normally takes place between May and July . Copulation occurs in May and June , and the lizards normally lay their eggs from the latter part of June through the beginning of July . The eggs are incubated at temperatures from 29 to 31C , and hatch after an average of 120 days . At birth , the baby lizards have a total length of around 25 cm. # Feeding , hunting , and diet # Like most members of the genus ' ' Varanus ' ' , ' ' V. griseus ' ' is a carnivore . The preferred prey of the species is mice , eggs , or fish , but it will also prey on smaller mammals , reptiles , birds , amphibians , insects , or other invertebrates , if the opportunity presents itself . # #Venom# # The possibility of venom in the genus ' ' Varanus ' ' is widely debated . Previously , venom was thought to be unique to Serpentes ( snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ' ' Varanus ' ' bite were thought to be due to oral bacteria alone , but recent studies have shown venom glands are more likely in the mouths of several , if not all of the species . ' ' V. griseus ' ' has not yet been specifically tested , but its bites have shown aftereffects consistent with the venomous bites from other varanid lizards . The venom can be used as a defensive mechanism to fend off predators , to help digest food , to sustain oral hygiene , and possibly to help in capturing and killing prey . # Conservation # ' ' V. griseus ' ' is not threatened in much of its habitat , although a great deal of the land previously inhabited by the subspecies ' ' V. g. caspius ' ' has been turned into farmland , which puts pressure on the species . Around 17,000 skins of this lizard are involved in commercial trade every year . While trading the skins internationally is prohibited by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of India , the species is unprotected from hunting laws and is still hunted commercially . # Captivity # These lizards rarely do well and , at most , live only a few years in captivity . On occasion , when their living requirements can be specifically met , they have been documented to live for more than 17 years , although they never become docile , and never become accustomed to being handled . In captivity , their environments should mirror those of many ground-dwelling animals , as well as their natural desert habitat . They require lower temperatures to hibernate during the winter , along with warmer temperatures during the summer months , and their diets in captivity should be similar to their diets in the wild . # Distribution # Jordan , Turkey ( from Urfa ) Eiselt ( 1970 ) , Bhme ( 1973 ) Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , Palestine , Israel , Syria , Lebanon , Iraq , Arabia , Oman , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , Western Sahara , Mauritania , Mali , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Kavir desert ) , Pakistan , NW India Type locality : Dardsha , coast of the Caspian Sea
