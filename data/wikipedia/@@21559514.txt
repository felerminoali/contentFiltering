The Thaumasia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) Astrogeology Research Program . The Thaumasia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-25 ( Mars Chart-25 ) . The Thaumasia quadrangle covers the area from 60 to 120 west longitude and 30 to 65 south latitude on Mars . One of the first major networks of stream channels , called Warrego Valles , were discovered here by early orbiters . Another sign of water is the presence of gullies carved into steep slopes . # Martian Gullies # Gullies are common in some parts of Mars . Gullies occur on steep slopes , especially on the walls of craters . Martian gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few , if any craters . Moreover , they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young . Usually , each gully has an alcove , channel , and apron . Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions , others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poleward facing slopes , especially from 30-44 S. Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them , the most popular involve liquid water coming from an aquifer , from melting at the base of old glaciers , or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer . Because of the good possibility that liquid water was involved with their formation and that they could be very young , scientists are excited . Maybe the gullies are where we should go to find life . There is evidence for all three theories . Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level , just as one would expect of an aquifer . Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin . One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers . Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow . They may consist of porous sandstone . The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms it would be called impermeable ) . Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down , the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally . Eventually , water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a breaklike a crater wall . The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies . Aquifers are quite common on Earth . A good example is Weeping Rock in Zion National Park Utah . As for the next theory , much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust . This ice-rich mantle , a few yards thick , smoothes the land , but in places it has a bumpy texture , resembling the surface of a basketball . The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies . Because there are few craters on this mantle , the mantle is relatively young . An excellent view of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crater Rim , as seen by HiRISE . The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes . Changes in Mars 's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas . During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere . The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust . The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles . Water vapor will condense on the particles , then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating . When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity , up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes . This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick . When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere , it leaves behind dust , which insulating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies . Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow . Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude . Very few gullies are found in the Thaumasia region ; however , a few are present in the lower elevations like the one pictured below in Ross Crater .

Because the gullies are on the narrow rim of a crater and they start at different heights , this example is not consistent with the model of gullies being caused by aquifers . **31;323;TOOLONG of gullies , as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program . Image:Multiple channels in 21461. jpgEnlargement of part of previous image showing smaller gullies inside larger ones . Water probably flowed in these gullies more than once .  The third theory might be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ground to melt and thus form the gullies . During a warmer climate , the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a debris flow similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast . Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow . Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough . Calculations show that a third of a mm of runoff can be produced each day for 50 days of each Martian year , even under current conditions . # Sand Dunes # Many places on Mars have sand dunes . Some craters in Thaumasia show dark blotches in them . High resolution photos show that the dark markings are dark sand dunes . Dark sand dunes probably contain the igneous rock basalt . Brashear Crater , pictured below , is one crater with dark dunes .

These networks are evidence that Mars may have once been warmer , wetter , and perhaps had precipitation in the form of rain or snow . A study with the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter , Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) and the Mars Orbiter Camera ( MOC ) support the idea that Warrego Valles was formed from precitation . At first glance they resemble river valleys on our Earth . But sharper images from more advanced cameras reveal that the valleys are not continuous . They are very old and may have suffered from the effects of erosion . A picture below shows some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Warrego Valles , as seen by THEMIS . These branched channels are strong evidence for flowing water on Mars , perhaps during a much warmer period .  # Other views from Thaumasia #  Image:Thaumasia Map.JPGMap of Thaumasia quadrangle with major craters labeled .
