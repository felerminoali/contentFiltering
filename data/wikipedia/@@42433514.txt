Proportional Myoelectric Control can be used to activate robotic lower limb exoskeletons . A proportional myoelectric control system utilizes a microcontroller or computer that inputs electromyography ( EMG ) signals from sensors on the leg muscle(s) and then activates the corresponding joint actuator(s) proportionally to the EMG signal . # Background # A robotic exoskeleton is a type of orthosis that uses actuators to either assist or resist the movement of a joint of an intact limb ; this is not to be confused with a powered prosthesis , which replaces a missing limb . There are four purposes that robotic lower limb exoskeletons can accomplish : * Enhancement of human performance , which typically deals with increasing strength or endurance ( see powered exoskeletons ) * Long-term assistance , which aims to provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk by themselves while wearing an exoskeleton * Study of human locomotion , which utilizes robotic exoskeletons to better understand human neuromuscular control , energetics , and/or kinematics of locomotion * Post-injury rehabilitation , which is intended to help an individual recover from an injury ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities ) by wearing an exoskeleton for a short time during training in order to perform better later without the use of the exoskeleton Robotic lower limb exoskeletons can be controlled by several methods , including a footswitch ( a pressure sensor attached to the bottom of the foot ) , gait phase estimation ( using joint angles to determine the current phase of walking ) , and myoelectric control ( using electromyography ) . This article focuses on myoelectric control . # Control Methods # Sensors on the skin detect electromyography ( EMG ) signals from the muscles of the wearers leg(s) . EMG signals can be measured from just one muscle or many , depending on the type of the exoskeleton and how many joints are actuated . Each signal measured is then sent to a controller , which is either an onboard microcontroller ( mounted to the exoskeleton ) or to a nearby computer . Onboard microcontrollers are used for long-term assistive devices since the wearer must be able to walk in different locations while wearing the exoskeleton , whereas computers not carried by the exoskeleton can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to walk very far in a clinical or lab environment . The controller filters out noise from the EMG signals and then normalizes them so as to better analyze the muscle activation pattern . The normalized EMG value of a muscle represents its activation percentage , since the EMG signal is normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible EMG reading for the muscle it came from . The maximum EMG reading is generated when a muscle is fully contracted . An alternative method to normalization is to proportionally match the actuator power to the EMG signal between a minimum activation threshold and an upper saturation level . # Direct Proportional Myoelectric Control # With a proportional myoelectric controller , the power sent to an actuator is proportional to the amplitude of the normalized EMG signal from a muscle . When the muscle is inactive , the actuator receives no power from the controller , and when the muscle is fully contracted , the actuator produces maximum torque about the joint it controls . For example , an powered ankle-foot orthosis ( AFO ) could employ a pneumatic artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the soleus ( one of the calf muscles ) . This control method enables the exoskeleton to be controlled by the same neural pathways as the wearer 's biological muscles and has been shown to allow individuals to walk with a more normal gait than other control methods , such as using a footswitch . Proportional myoelectric control of robotic lower limb exoskeletons has advantages over other control methods , such as : * Its physiological nature allows for an effective way to scale the magnitude of mechanical assistance from the exoskeleton * It results in reduced biological muscle recruitment versus kinematic based control methods * It allows easy adaptation of the exoskeleton control for new motor tasks However , proportional myoelectric control also has disadvantages compared to other control methods , including : * The surface electrode interface can often cause difficulties in obtaining a reliable EMG signal * The system requires tuning to determine the appropriate thresholds and gains * The musculoskeletal system has many synergistic muscles that are not easily accessible via surface EMG electrodes * Since neurological disorders result in decreased neuromuscular control , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use an exoskeleton with myoelectric control # Proportional Myoelectric Control with Flexor Inhibition # Direct proportional control works well when each joint of the exoskeleton is actuated in one direction ( uni-directional actuation ) , such as a pneumatic piston only bending the knee , but is less effective when two joint actuators work in opposition ( bi-directional actuation ) . An example of this would be ankle exoskeleton using one pneumatic artificial muscle for dorsiflexion based on tibialis anterior ( shin muscle ) EMG and another pneumatic artificial muscle for plantar flexion based on soleus ( calf muscle ) EMG . This could result in a large degree of co-activation of the two actuators and make walking more difficult.Ferris , D.P. , Gordon , K.E. , Sawicki , G.S . and Peethambaran , A. : An improved powered ankle-foot orthosis using proportional myoelectric control , ' ' Gait and Posture ' ' , 23 , pp 425-428 , 2006 To correct for this unwanted co-activation , a rule can be added to the control scheme so that artificial dorsiflexor activation is inhibited when soleus EMG is above a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more natural gait than with direct proportional control ; flexor inhibition also allows subjects to walk much more easily with combined knee and ankle exoskeletons with bi-directional actuators at each joint . # Applications # # Performance Enhancement # Performance enhancement deals with increasing typical human capabilities , such as strength or endurance . Many full-body robotic exoskeletons currently in development use controllers based on joint torques and angles instead of electromyography . See powered exoskeletons. # Long Term Assistance # One application of a robot lower limb exoskeleton is to assist in the movement of a disabled individual in order to walk . Individuals with spinal cord injury , weakened leg muscles , poor neuromuscular control , or who have suffered a stroke could benefit from wearing such a device . The exoskeleton provides torque about a joint in the same direction that EMG data indicate the joint is rotating . For example , high EMG signals in the vastus medialis ( a quadriceps muscle ) and low EMG signals in the biceps femoris ( a hamstring muscle ) would indicate that the user is extending his/her leg , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten the leg . # Study of human locomotion # Proportional myoelectric control and robotic exoskeletons have been used in upper limb devices for decades , but engineers have only recently begun utilizing them for lower limb devices to better understand human biomechanics and neural control of locomotion . By using an exoskeleton with a proportional myoelectric controller , scientists can use a non-invasive means of studying the neural plasticity associated with modifying a muscle 's force ( biological +/- artificial force ) , as well as how motor memories for locomotor control are formed . which can require up to three physical therapists to help partially support the body weight of the individual . Robotic lower limb exoskeletons could help in both of these areas . # Physiological Response # The neuromuscular system has targeted joint torques it tries to generate while walking . Assistive exoskeletons produce some of the torque needed to move one or more leg joints while walking , which allows a healthy individual to generate less muscle torque in those joints and use less metabolic energy . The muscle torque is reduced enough to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking without an exoskeleton . The net torque about each joint is the muscular torque plus the actuator torque . Disabled individuals do not see much of a decrease , if any , in muscular torque while walking with an exoskeleton because their muscles are not strong enough to walk with a normal gait , or at all ; the exoskeleton provides the remaining torque needed for them to walk . # Examples # * Vanderbilt exoskeleton * ReWalk * HAL 5 * Ekso Bionics # See also # * Orthotics * Neural control of limb stiffness * Powered exoskeleton * # References #
