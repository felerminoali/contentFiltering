Gabriel ( 1776 October 10 , 1800 ) , today commonlyif incorrectlyknown as Gabriel Prosser , was a literate enslaved blacksmith who planned a large slave rebellion in the Richmond area in the summer of 1800 . Information regarding the revolt was leaked prior to its execution , and he and twenty-five followers were taken captive and hanged in punishment . In reaction , Virginia and other state legislatures passed restrictions on free blacks , as well as prohibiting the education , assembly , and hiring out of slaves , to restrict their chances to learn and to plan similar rebellions . In 2002 the City of Richmond passed a resolution in honor of Gabriel on the 202nd anniversary of the rebellion . In 2007 Governor Tim Kaine gave Gabriel and his followers an informal pardon , in recognition that his cause , the end of slavery and the furtherance of equality for all peoplehas prevailed in the light of history . # Life and background # Born into slavery at Brookfield , a tobacco plantation in Henrico County , Virginia , Gabriel had two brothers , Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the owner . As Gabriel and Solomon were trained as blacksmiths , their father may have had that skill . Gabriel was also taught to read and write . By the mid-1790s , as Gabriel neared the age of twenty , he stood six feet two or three inches high . His long and bony face , well made , was marred by the loss of his two front teeth and two or three scars on his head . White people as well as blacks regarded the literate young man as a fellow of great courage and intellect above his rank in life . # Gabriel 's Rebellion # Gabriel planned the revolt during the spring and summer of 1800 . On August 30 , 1800 , Gabriel intended to lead slaves into Richmond , but the rebellion was postponed because of rain . The slaves ' owners had suspicion of the uprising , and two slaves told their owner , Mosby Sheppard , about the plans . He warned Virginia 's Governor , James Monroe , who called out the state militia . Gabriel escaped downriver to Norfolk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reward offered by the state . That slave did not receive the full reward . Gabriel was returned to Richmond for questioning , but he did not submit . Gabriel , his two brothers , and 23 other slaves were hanged . # Historiography # The historian Douglas Egerton offered a new perspective on Gabriel in his book ' ' Gabriel 's Rebellion : The Virginia Slave Conspiracies of 1800 &amp; 1802 ' ' ( 1993 ) . He based this on extensive primary research from surviving contemporary documents . Egerton found that Gabriel was a skilled blacksmith who was mostly hired out by his owner in Richmond foundries . Hiring out was the way that slaveholders earned money from their slaves , whom they needed less for labor as they had reduced the cultivation of tobacco as a crop . The market for tobacco was depressed , but Virginia planters also had to deal with depleted soils because of the crop . Slaveholders leased skilled slaves for jobs available in Virginia industries . Egerton concluded that Gabriel would have been stimulated and challenged at the foundries by interacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hoped Thomas Jefferson 's Republicans would liberate them from domination by the wealthy Federalist merchants of the city . In that environment , Gabriel also would have heard about the uprising and struggles of slaves in Saint Domingue . Egerton believed that Gabriel had two white co-conspirators , at least one of whom was identified as a French national . He found reports that documentary evidence of their identity or involvement was sent to Governor Monroe but never produced in court , and suggests that it was to protect the Jefferson 's Democratic-Republican Party . Egerton noted that Gabriel did not order his followers to kill all whites except Methodists , Quakers and Frenchmen ; rather , he instructed them not to kill any people in those three categories . During this period , Methodists and Quakers were active missionaries for manumission , and many slaves had been freed since the end of the Revolution in part due to their work . The French were considered allies as they had abolished slavery in their Caribbean colonies in 1794 . Gabriel initially escaped on a ship owned by a former overseer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who repeatedly overlooked information as to Gabriel 's true identity . A slave hired out to work on the ship turned in Gabriel , seeking the reward so that he could purchase his own freedom . The state paid him only $50 , not the $300 advertised . # Influence # Gabriel 's uprising was notable not because of its resultsthe rebellion was quelled before it could beginbut because of its potential for mass chaos and widespread violence . In Virginia in 1800 , 39.2 percent of the total population were slaves ; they were concentrated on plantations in the Tidewater area and west of Richmond . No reliable numbers existed regarding slave and free black conspirators ; most likely , the number of men actively involved numbered only several hundred . From 1780 to 1810 , the number of slaves freed in the Upper South had grown markedly , as some slaveholders were inspired to free slaves by the American Revolution and its ideals . Methodists and Quakers especially worked to convince slaveholders to manumit slaves . The percentage of free blacks as part of the black population rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent by 1810 . By that time , Virginia 's free blacks numbered 30,466 or 7.2 percent of the total black population . By 1810 nearly three-quarters of Delaware 's blacks were free . Some Virginia slaveholders were nervous about the sharp increase in the number of free blacks in the slave state . They were uneasy as well by the violent aftermath of the French Revolution and the uprising of slaves in the 1790s in Saint Domingue . In 1792 France granted social equality to free people of color , and in 1793 French Revolutionary commissioners in Saint-Domingue granted freedom to all the slaves . Whites and free people of color , some of whom were also slaveholders , emigrated as refugees to the US during the years of upheaval , now known as the Haitian Revolution . They added to the population of free people of color in Charleston , Richmond and New Orleans . In addition , slaveholders brought thousands of ethnic African slaves with them , especially adding to the African population of New Orleans . In 1804 the black and mulatto revolutionaries succeeded in gaining freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gabriel had been able to plan the rebellion because of relatively lax rules of movement for slaves between plantations and the city , as so many had been hired out , and others traveled to and from the city on errands for their masters . After the rebellion , many slaveholders greatly restricted the slaves ' rights of travel when not working . Fears of a slave revolt regularly swept major slaveholding communities . Prior to the rebellion , Virginia law had allowed education of slaves to read and write , and training of slaves in skilled trades . After the rebellion , and after a second conspiracy was discovered in 1802 among enslaved boatmen along the Appomattox and Roanoke Rivers , the Virginia Assembly in 1808 banned hiring out of slaves and required freed blacks to leave the state within 12 months or face re-enslavement ( 1806 ) . Free blacks had to petition the legislature to stay in the state , and were often aided in that goal by white friends or allies . In addition to the catalyst of Gabriel 's Rebellion , the law against residency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of color in Virginia , as noted above in manumission of slaves after the American Revolution . The very existence of free blacks challenged the conditions of slave states . # Legacy and honors # Gabriel 's rebellion served as an important example of slaves ' taking action to gain freedom . * In 2002 the City of Richmond adopted a resolution to commemorate the 202nd anniversary of the execution of the patriot and freedom fighter , Gabriel , whose death stands as a symbol for the determination and struggle of slaves to obtain freedom , justice and equality as promised by the fundamental principles of democratic governments of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America . * In the fall of 2006 , the Virginia State Conference of the NAACP requested Gov . Tim Kaine pardon Gabriel in recognition of his contributions to the civil rights struggle of African Americans and all peoples . * On August 30 , 2007 , Governor Kaine informally pardoned Gabriel and his co-conspirators . Kaine said that Gabriel 's motivation had been his devotion to the ideals of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that Gabriel 's causethe end of slavery and the furtherance of equality of all peoplehas prevailed in the light of history , and added that it is important to acknowledge that history favorably regards Gabriel 's cause while consigning legions who sought to keep him and others in chains to be forgotten . The pardon was informal because it was posthumous . # Representation in other media # *Arna Bontemps wrote ' ' Black Thunder ' ' ( 1936 ) , a historical novel based on Gabriel 's Rebellion . # Songs # * Tim Barry , a singer/songwriter from Richmond , wrote and performed Prosser 's Gabriel for the album ' ' 28th &amp; Stonewall ' ' . It chronicles the events of Gabriel 's life , focusing on the attempted revolution . * Gabriel is mentioned in Public Enemy 's song Prophets of Rage . * Gabriel is the hero of a cleverly subversive sea shanty recorded some forty years after events ( in Chapter 17 of Frederick Marryat 's book , ' ' Poor Jack ' ' ( 1840 ) . ) In the book the shanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its subject as General Gabriel , and claims a bounty of 1000 was put on his head .
