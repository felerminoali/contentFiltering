Kath is eager to have Mr Sloane as a tenant at her home , which she shares with her nearly blind father , Kemp . In getting to know Mr Sloane , Kath is open with Mr Sloane about a previous relationship she had , which led to her bearing a child , whom her brother insisted on her giving up for adoption as it was conceived out of wedlock . Mr Sloane reveals he is himself an orphan , though vague about his parents ' death , aside from the fact they passed away together . Kath 's father has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same man who killed his employer some years earlier . After an altercation between Kemp and Sloane , resulting in Sloane being stabbed in the leg , Kath begins to make somewhat subtle advances toward the young man . When Mr Sloane attempts to reciprocate , Kath warns him facetiously not to betray his trust . Kathy 's brother Ed arrives soon after to find the visitor staying with his sister , much to his dismay . Kemp has an estranged relationship with his son as he found him to be committing some kind of felony in the bedroom as a teenager . Despite Ed 's initial opposition to Mr Sloane staying with his sister , after speaking with Sloane , Ed eventually relents and even goes so far as to offer him a job as his chauffeur . As Sloane recovers from his injury earlier in the evening , Kath returns wearing a transparent negligee and seemingly seduces Mr Sloane as the lights go down and Act One ends . Act 2 The action resumes ' some months later and begins with Mr Sloane recounting an evening in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguously hints at her jealousy , before ultimately revealing she is pregnant and concerned that her brother will strongly disapprove . Ed arrives soon after and discovers that Mr Sloane had taken his car out joyriding the night before with his friends . Upon finding out that they also had a woman with them , Ed divulges that he feels women are crude , and misleading . Ed advises Sloane to pack his things as he will be on call as his assistant at all hours . When Sloane leaves the room to pack , Kemp mildly attempts to reconcile with his son , and conveys that Kath and Sloane have been sleeping together and believes Kath is now pregnant . When confronted , Sloane confirms he has been sleeping with Kath , but claims she threw herself at him . A short time later , Ed departs to buy cigarettes , and Kemp returns to confront Sloane as his employer 's murderer . Sloane eventually attacks Kemp , resulting in his death . Act 3 Upon finding his dead father , Ed is initially insistent that justice be served and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloane persuades Ed to fabricate a story to make the death appear an accident , in exchange for his servitude . When Kath discovers the dead body , she is apprehensive to stray from the truth especially given Sloane 's intention to go and live with her brother . Sloane finds himself in a predicament : if he stays with Kath , Ed will report the murder to the authorities , and vice versa if he chooses to leave with Ed . Ultimately , a compromise is reached that will result in the pair sharing Mr. Sloane a few months at a time . # Productions # The play premiered in the West End in 1964 , thanks to the financial support of Terence Rattigan , who had seen the play at the New Arts Theatre , rated it highly and put up 3,000 in sponsorship .
