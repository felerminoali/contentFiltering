It follows the adventures of a present-day , multinational exploration team traveling on the Ancient spaceship ' ' Destiny ' ' over 700 million light years distant from the Milky Way Galaxy . They evacuated there and are now trying to figure out a way to return to Earth , while simultaneously trying to explore and to survive in their unknown area of the universe . The series , created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper , premiered in the United States on Syfy on October 2 , 2009 . The series featured an ensemble cast and was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver , BC , Canada . A second season of 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 10 episodes of the second season were aired in the United States beginning on September 28 , 2010 , and the final 10 were shown beginning on March 7 , 2011 . Syfy announced on December 16 , 2010 that it would not be picking up ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' for a third season . The second season of ' ' SGU ' ' ended as a semi-cliffhanger . To resolve this , a movie was planned ; however , due to timing constraints , ' ' Stargate ' ' writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced on April 17 , 2011 that the ' ' SGU ' ' movie had been cancelled . # Premise # The Stargate program has founded Icarus base on a remote planet whose Stargate is powered by large naquadria deposits throughout the core . The team , led by Dr. Nicholas Rush , postulate that the power from that core could allow them to use a 9-chevron code to dial into the Stargate , allowing them access to locations far remote from their galaxy , but lack the means to translate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . Dr. Rush designs a video game used across Earth to find brilliant minds to interpret the puzzle , which Eli Wallace , a young mathematics genius , is able to solve . Eli is reluctantly brought to Icarus base along with a contingent of guests of honor aboard the ' ' Hammond ' ' , a Daedalus-class starship battlecruiser ; the guests include Senator Armstrong , who funds the Icarus Project , and his daughter Chloe . They are introduced to the base 's military staff , led by Colonel Everett Young , Colonel David Telford , First Lieutenants Matthew Scott and Tamara Johansen , and Master Sergeant Ronald Greer . Dr. Rush and Eli work together to discover the means to dial the ninth chevron , just as the base is attacked by members of the Lucian Alliance . Colonel Telford aids in an aerial assault of the ships with the ' ' Hammond ' ' , while the base starts dialing Earth into the Stargate , finding that the planet 's power core is about to explode . Dr. Rush realizes that the explosion would follow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stargate with the ninth chevron , successfully opening a wormhole . The surviving Icarus Base members flee through the wormhole before the planet explodes . They find themselves aboard an old abandoned spacecraft made by the Ancients , which Dr. Rush finds was named ' ' Destiny ' ' . The eighty-some survivors begin to assure the safety of their team , during which Senator Armstrong sacrifices himself to seal an air leak in one of ' ' Destiny ' ' s shuttles . As the rest of the team works to make the ship hospitable , Dr. Rush , Eli , and other scientific members of Icarus Base start to understand the function of ' ' Destiny ' ' ; they are not able to directly control the ship , and find that it will drop out of faster-than-light travel to allow its Stargate to connect to a number of nearby worlds for a fixed period of time before it continues ; it fuels itself by diving into the outermost layer of a nearby star and collecting energy from it ; the first time the ' ' Destiny ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they understood why it happened . The crew is able to remain in contact with Earth via a set of Ancient communication stones that Colonel Young brought , and are told to continue the Stargate mission of exploring that galaxy , while searching for a way to return home . # Cast # * Robert Carlyle as Nicholas Rush The ship 's brilliant Machiavellian scientist whom producer Joseph Mallozzi had first mentioned in his blog in mid-November 2008 as Dr. David Rush . The ship 's crew believe Rush to be losing his mind , but he does things for a reason . Carlyle explained in an interview that after Rush lost his wife to cancer , he became driven by the opportunity to explore the galaxy . Mallozzi rectified casting reports in mid-December 2008 that Rush is not the leader of the unplanned expedition . That honor falls to Colonel Everett Young . For now . But things could have a way of changing on board a ship manned by a disparate group with very different agendas .. . Although a confirmed main character , Rush was not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended the character to be very different from any previous main characters in the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise , somebody who is not the hero , not the villain , and more of a very flawed and complex person . About a year before being cast , Scottish actor Robert Carlyle wanted to try something new in his career and approached television companies in Los Angeles . They offered him several parts , but ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' had the greatest appeal to him as suddenly a drama was opening up in space , and in the past that was something that was slightly missing from the genre . He was aware of the success of the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise and had seen quite a bit of ' ' SG-1 ' ' , plus a bunch of ' ' Atlantis ' ' . Carlyle accepted the role because of Wright and Cooper 's take on the drama and direction of the show , and he was more than prepared to play the character for possibly many years . Carlyle kept his Scottish accent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the initial character breakdown as a handsome , capable , former SG team leader in his 40s who holds the rank of Colonel . He is like the Jack O'Neill of ten years ago yet has sharper edges . At the beginning of ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' , he has been married for approximately five years and is the temporary commander of a secret off-world base . Young is Rush 's nemesis on the ship . * Brian J. Smith as Matthew Scott A 26-year-old skilled and well-trained Airman and junior SGC member holding the rank of First Lieutenant . He is mentally unprepared for the urgency of the situation aboard the ship . He was named Jared Nash in the initial casting call . Before being cast , Brian J. Smith had been working as a stage actor in New York for a year and a half . Smith taped his ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' audition and was invited to a screen test in Los Angeles . He received the news of being cast a few days after the screen test . He prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the ' ' Stargate ' ' TV series before being cast , but caught up with much of ' ' SG-1 ' ' afterwards . * Elyse Levesque as Chloe Armstrong She is a stunning and sexy daughter of a US Senator , 23 years old , whose character is tested after her father 's tragic death and the dire circumstances of being trapped on a spaceship . Her father ( played by Christopher McDonald ) had political oversight over the Stargate project trying to dial the ninth chevron . Before the producers settled on the final name , the character was named Chloe Carpenter and Chloe Walker . Levesque 's wonderfully nuanced audition convinced the producers to cast her , as she demonstrated an impressive range in two very different and demanding scenes . * David Blue as Eli Wallace Named Eli Hitchcock in the casting call , Eli Wallace is a total slacker in his early twenties and an utter genius in mathematics , computers and other fields . He is a social outcast with an acerbic sense of humor , and lacks confidence in his intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ' ' Good Will Hunting ' ' with a little Jack Black thrown in . He was the main source of comic relief in the show . David Blue , a self-declared fan of the science fiction series , has seen all ' ' SG-1 ' ' and ' ' Atlantis ' ' episodes . * Alaina Huffman as Tamara Johansen Named Tamara Jon in the character breakdown , she is an SGC medic in her mid-twenties with off-world experience and the rank of First Lieutenant . Friends call her T.J. She finds herself the most medically experienced person aboard the ship after the death of the Icarus Base doctor in the pilot episode Air ( according to co-creator Robert C. Cooper ) . She has a modest background , yet is beautiful , tough , smart and capable , but also has a secretive past with another member of the ' ' Destiny ' ' s new crew . At the beginning of the series , she is overwhelmed by the lack of medical knowledge , experience , medicines , and supplies aboard the ship . Mallozzi considered Huffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly , we would 've been crazy not to cast her . * Jamil Walker Smith as Ronald Greer In early casting documents named Ron Psycho Stasiak , Ronald Greer is a big , strong , silent Marine with a mysterious past who lacks control over his temper in non-combat situations . The character breakdown compares him to Eric Bana 's character Hoot in ' ' Black Hawk Down ' ' . His rank is Master Sergeant . * Ming-Na as Camile Wray Camile Wray is the first openly gay character in the Stargate franchise . She is the IOA representative on ' ' Destiny ' ' and supports civilian leadership on the ship . Ming-Na was credited as a regular character in the first two episodes . She was downgraded to a recurring character from then on until the episode Justice , in which she returned and continued as a regular character . # Production # # Conception # ' ' Stargate ' ' producers Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper conceived ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' as a completely separate , third entity in the live-action ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantis ' ' , which was created as a spin-off from the first series ' ' Stargate SG-1 ' ' . They wanted to produce a stylistically and totally different TV series with a more mature and fresh story approach so as not to get too repetitive . Wright and Cooper originally planned to write the pilot script for ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' during the summer of 2007 , making a 2008 premiere possible . Since their ambitions with the previous live-action ' ' Stargate ' ' series were often restricted by the low budget and risked coming across as silly , they pitched the show as an expensive series to the Sci Fi Channel ( now Syfy ) in the last quarter of 2007 . Although the pitch was well-received , the project was put on hold because of the on-going work on ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' and ' ' Stargate : Continuum ' ' , and the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike . The series was given the official greenlight for a 2009 debut by Syfy on August 22 , 2008 , shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been announced . Joseph Mallozzi explained that a new series would have lower salaries and licensing fees than a new sixth season of ' ' Atlantis ' ' would have had . MGM co-funded the project . According to co-star Robert Carlyle , each episode had a budget of $2 million US dollars . Brad Wright pitched the series and its first five episodes to the ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' writers and producers in mid-September 2008 . Wright , Cooper , and Carl Binder produce the show , while Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie serve as writers and consultant producers . ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' writers Martin Gero and Alan McCullough contribute scripts , but are not part of the regular writer staff . New writers were initially sought for freelance scripts and possible staff positions . Author John Scalzi was hired as a creative consultant , a background rather than foreground sort of job . Most of the ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' crew , such as stunt coordinator James Bamford and composer Joel Goldsmith , have moved over to ' ' Universe ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulars ( created for casting calls ) leaked on the internet on September 17 , 2008 . Joseph Mallozzi explained the largely negative initial fan reaction as a passionate response to the preceding cancellation announcement of ' ' Atlantis ' ' . Brad Wright dismissed negative comments as a sole reaction to the wording of the network ; character breakdowns are written to aid casting directors and agents in the selection process , and always sound shallow , and if they 're written to appear ' deep ' it 's just ridiculous . Robert C. Cooper replied to concerns of young age that the ' ' SG-1 ' ' cast was also quite young in their first season . The producers were looking for people who are a little more identifiable and contemporary , with an everyman on the street point of view after being challenged by the situation . Martin Gero considered ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' as an ensemble show , more than the previous two ' ' Stargate ' ' live-action series were . Auditions were held in Los Angeles . The producers were looking for well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast either new faces , or people you 've seen in other stuff but maybe are n't as aware of . BAFTA and Screen Actors Guild Award-winning actor Robert Carlyle was the first announced series regular in mid-December 2008 . The casting of Louis Ferreira , David Blue , Brian J. Smith , and Jamil Walker Smith as series regulars was announced in mid-January 2009 . The casting of Alaina Huffman and Elyse Levesque was announced in late February 2009 , along with other actors whose status as regular or recurring cast has not been established . The cast is American ( Blue , B. Smith , J. Smith , Ming-Na ) , Canadian ( Ferreira , Levesque , and Huffman ) and British ( Carlyle ) . # Writing and filming # The writers started drafting stories for the first season in mid-November 2008 . The United States Air Force and Marine Corps reviewed the scripts . The projected film start of ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' was initially slated for February 4 , 2009 , but was moved to February 18 , 2009 . The show is filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' set ) and 5 ( Icarus Base set ) at The Bridge Studios ( ' ' SG-1 ' ' and ' ' Atlantis ' ' had been filmed at stages 5 and 6 ) and on location in and around Vancouver , British Columbia . Air ( Part 3 ) was filmed in and around Alamogordo , New Mexico from late April through early May 2009 . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' will show computer-generated worlds filmed in digital sets . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' will have a markedly different shooting style for more reality and immediacy with inspiration from ' ' Cloverfield ' ' , as if a documentary crew were to ride along on this adventure to outer space . # Pre-broadcast marketing # Sci Fi Wire published concept art of the ' ' Destiny ' ' in October 2008 . The first promotional picture of the cast ( out of costume and in casual clothing ) was released on March 20 , 2009 . The same day , Syfy began airing thirty-second trailers of ' ' Universe ' ' , showing various clips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ' ' SGU ' ' Stargate with the first visual effects . MGM revealed its revamped ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' website on July 8 with an interactive virtual set tour of the ' ' Destiny ' ' , interviews with the cast , character profiles and videos . Joseph Mallozzi began posting concept art and behind-the-scenes photos of the ' ' SGU ' ' set on his blog afterwards . Brad Wright , Robert C. Cooper and most members of the main cast appeared at an ' ' SGU ' ' panel at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 24 , 2009 . Behind-the-scenes material is shot for future online and DVD use . # Premise and themes # ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' is set on the spaceship ' ' Destiny ' ' , which was launched by the race known as the Ancients from the Milky Way galaxy several million years ago . Several ships were sent ahead of it to seed the universe with Stargates . The Ancients had planned on using the Stargate aboard Destiny to board that ship when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned the project after looking into ascension amongst other things . In order to reach this ship , an address would have to be dialed consisting of nine chevrons , a possibility that had been unknown in the previous ' ' Stargate ' ' series , due to energy constraints . The series begins when a team of soldiers and scientists from present-day Earth escape through the Stargate and arrive on the ' ' Destiny ' ' after their base is attacked . Many of its primary systems are damaged or failing , and they are unable to return to Earth or even maneuver the ship . However , the ' ' Destiny ' ' periodically stops to dial the Stargate to planets with necessary supplies to repair the ship , and sustain human life . The writers have discussed the possibility that each season represents a voyage of the ' ' Destiny ' ' through a different galaxy . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' is intended to appeal to both veteran fans and newcomers , being firmly entrenched in established ' ' Stargate ' ' mythology without relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stargate ' ' themes of adventure and exploration , but focuses mostly on the people aboard the ship . ' ' SGU ' ' is also more serialized than its predecessors , although the writers attempted to resolve each character story within the episode . There was a conscious effort to avoid making ' ' SGU ' ' too serialized , with the serialization stemming mainly from character development . The industry described the show with the buzzwords dark and edgy . According to Robert C. Cooper , the essence of the story is that sort of fear and terror of a tragedy combined with the sense that there is hope for us in the basic ways in which human beings survive . The planned increased levels of drama are balanced with humor to avoid pretentiousness . The differences between good and evil are meant to be less apparent , as the ship is populated with flawed and unprepared characters who are not supposed to go there . According to Brad Wright , the show should hopefully explore the truly alien , and avoid the rubber faced English-speaking ones . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' ' SG-1 ' '  '  s Goa'uld and ' ' Atlantis ' '  '  Wraith. # Broadcast and release # # Home video release # # Impact # # Awards and nominations # The episode Time won a Writers Guild of Canada Award for best one-hour TV series and both Air and Space were nominated for Outstanding Special Visual Effects For A Series at the 2010 Primetime Emmy Awards . Robert Carlyle won Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role for the first season episode Human at the 2010 Gemini Awards . # Critical reception # Metacritic summarizes the response as generally favorable reviews for SGU 's first season , but with several critics showing reservation . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' was well received by several major media publishers upon airing of the pilot episode . Mike Hale from ' ' The New York Times ' ' was generally positive towards the pilot episodes , saying the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise was catching up with the long-running ' ' Star Trek ' ' franchise . Hale also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Stargate ' ' . ' ' The Boston Globe ' ' reviewer Joanna Weiss also reacted positively towards the pilot episodes , saying it felt like early ' ' Lost ' ' , while the story arc followed the patterns of ' ' Battlestar Galactica ' ' . Mark Wilson from About.com gave the episode four-and-a-half stars out of 5 , saying ' ' Universe ' ' accomplishes what ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' was not able to , and said it was exceptionally well made compared to other shows . The ' ' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ' ' both praised the show , calling it intriguing , for not abandoning its premise as ' ' Star Trek : Voyager ' ' did and criticized it by pointing out that the characters spend far too much time wandering a desert planet in Air ( Part 3 ) . ' ' The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ' ' summarized their review by saying that , given time , ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' may become worth watching if it develops its characters and continues to mine its premise for stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Daily News ' ' gave the episodes four out of five stars , saying that Eli 's not the only one playing a high-stakes game here . Among reviewers who were negative towards the new installments was Maureen Ryan from the ' ' Chicago Tribune ' ' . The reviewer wrote that the gloomy , underwhelming ' ' Universe ' ' seems to have ditched many of the elements that the previous Stargate shows had , notably camaraderie and a sense of adventure , without adding much in the way of narrative suspense or complexity . The only characters she felt were worth following were Eli Wallace and Nicholas Rush . Vince Horiuchi from ' ' The Salt Lake Tribune ' ' , while not overall positive to the series , said the cast and characters were a little more likable and interesting than previous entries in the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise . Reviewer Laura Freis from ' ' Variety ' ' concluded her review with Sure , ' ' SGU ' ' is grittier , darker and psychologically deeper than previous versions . But so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the show , she called Robert Carlyle an excellent actor . ' ' The Hollywood Reporter ' ' noted a lack of intelligent and surprising stories and was overall negative towards ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' , and even more so on the previous ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise releases . The show has also been criticized for its similarities to the reimagined ' ' Battlestar Galactica ' ' . In its second season , SGU had declined in viewership ratings .
