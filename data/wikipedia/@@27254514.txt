The Texas Ballet Theater was founded by Margo Dean and Fernando Schaffenburg in 1961 as the Fort Worth Ballet , in Fort Worth , Texas . It became a fully professional ballet company in 1985 . In 1988 , after the demise of Dallas Ballet , the company began adding performances of The Nutcracker in Dallas in a business partnership with The Dallas Opera , producing Nutcracker performances in The Music Hall and using The Dallas Opera Orchestra . Fort Worth Ballet became the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet in 1994 when The Dallas Supporters of FWDB , a separate 501(c)3 corporation with its own Board of Directors , was established in Dallas . The Dallas Supporters ' responsibility was primarily to raise contributed funds so that Fort Worth Dallas Ballet could perform a full season in Dallas in the Music Hall at Fair Park . A detailed Joint Venture Agreement was established between the two organizations . FWDB - the Fort Worth organization - remained the primary employer and producing entity . All dancers , production staff and most administrative staff were employees of FWDB . The Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FWDB and The Dallas Supporters would negotiate an agreement outlining which and how many productions would occur in Dallas . The two organizations operated under this two corporation / two board structure for nine seasons . In 2001 , the Dallas Supporters were not able to raise the funds needed to produce the Ballet 's Dallas season , forcing FWDB to cancel productions planned in Dallas for early 2002 ; one Fort Worth production was also cancelled . This occurred during a season when FWDB had no permanent artistic director . Bruce Marks was serving as Artistic Advisor and Bruce Simpson as Ballet-Master-in-Chief . Over the 2002-2003 season , an agreement to merge the two corporations and their Boards was created . The resulting organization was then was renamed Texas Ballet Theater in 2003 . Texas Ballet Theater is a resident company of Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth and the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House at the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center in Dallas . # Artistic staff # As of May 2010 : * Ben Stevenson , O.B.E. - Artistic Director * Tim O'Keefe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director * Anna Donovan - Principal Ballet Master # Company dancers # As of May 2010 : # Dancers # * Paul Adams * Adam Boreland * Robin Bangert * Max Caro * Katelyn Clenaghan * Carl Coomer * Heather Kotelenets * Jaclyn Gill * Jennifer Hooper * Kelly Kristen Irvine * Carolyn Judson * Lisa Kaczmarek * Angela Kenny * Thomas Kilps * Alexander Kotelenets * Michelle LeBoeuf * Lainey Logan * Betsy McBride * Leticia Oliveira * Lucas Priolo * Danny Ryan * Victoria Simo * Philip Slocki * Eddy Tovar * Mark Troxler * Joamanuel Velazquez * Peter Zweifel * Simon Wexler *Havilah Sprunk # Apprentices # * Dustin Geradine * Paige Nyman * Andrew Hellerick * Morgan Stinnett * Kaitlyn Potts * Drake Humphreys # Trainees # * Julianna Bicki * Ali Paige Block *Nicole Von Enck * Amy Hollinger * Emma Pressman * Allisyn Hsieh # Directors # Artistic Directors *Margo Dean 1961-1964 *Fernando Schaffenburg , 1964- *Anthony Salatino , 1982-1985 *Nanette Glushak and Michel Rahn , 1985-1987 *Paul Mejia , 1987-1998 *Ben Houk , 1998-2001 *Bruce Marks , Artistic Advisor ; Bruce Simpson , Ballet-Master-in-Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advisor , Tim O'Keefe , Ballet Master , 2002-2003 ( interim leadership ) *Ben Stevenson , 2003 to present Executive Directors *Tom Adams *Mark Denton , 1988-1990 *David Mallette , 1990-2005 *Gary Wortley , 2005 *John Toohey , 2006-2008 *Margo McCann , Managing Director , 2008-present # References # **14;2080;references
