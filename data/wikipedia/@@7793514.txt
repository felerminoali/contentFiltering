The following is the Slovak Order of Battle in 1939 during the SlovakHungarian War . # Overview # The Slovak Army was newly born from the disorganized remnants of the former and well-equipped Czechoslovak Army and Air Force . Such was Slovakia 's lack of preparedness , that the motorised Hungarian columns initially met almost no resistance , reportedly surprising two companies of Slovaks in their beds. # The situation of the Slovak Army # Lieutenant-General Augustn Malr was responsible for the defence of the eastern border with Ruthenia . VI Corps , which he had inherited from the Czecho-Slovak Army , had already been seriously disrupted the previous autumn by the Vienna Award , which had obliged it to abandon its border fortifications and remove its headquarters from Koice to Preov . The Hungarian occupation of Ruthenia ( Carpatho-Ukraine ) , where the garrison , the 12th Division , had come under VI Corps ' jurisdiction , had further undermined it . As VI Corps had largely been based among unlreliable Hungarians and Ruthenes , it had a very high proportion of Czechs in its ranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into eastern Slovakia over the period of March 14-18 , but it then dissolved itself virtually completely as its Czech officers and men headed for home . Similarly , the regiments of the VI Corps ' Slovak-based 11th and 17th Divisions , which should have had 2000-3000 men each , were only left with between 70 and 400 Slovaks apiece once all their Czechs had gone home . This left the eastern border virtually undefended . Therefore , Malr began to fill out his skeleton units with the reservists called up on March 15 . At the same time , Generals Jurech and Imro , in the west of the country began to form units to support Malr as Slovak officers and conscripts began to return from Bohemia and Moravia , but their move to the east was delayed because roads and railways became crowded with Czech troops being repatriated in the opposite direction . The whole repatriation and reinforcement operation had to be organised by the various inexperienced and desperately overstretched Slovak staffs , especially that of Malr in Preov . There was often bad feelings on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be roundly abused at the station by a Slovak officer , who assumed from his rank that he must be a Czech . Some Czech troops sabotaged their equipment rather than let the Slovaks have it . Malr did manage to persuade a number of Czech officers to stay on temporarily to help Slovakia against the Hungarians , but the general confusion could not be adequately sorted out during the very brief period of hostilities with Hungary . These factors also prevented the remains of the Czechoslovak 3rd Rapid Division , which was based in the far west of the country from being deployed to good effect in the east . Its 3rd Tank Regiment was left with only 10 out of 60 officers and 222 out of 821 other ranks when all the Czech soldiers went home . This was a decisive disadvantage , because the regiment 's 70 LT vz. 34 and LT vz. 35 light tanks , 30 KD/Praga Tanik vz. 33 tankettes , 3 OA vz. 27 and 10 OA vz. 30 armoured cars were more than a match for the five obsolete Fiat 3000B light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armoured cars of the Hungarian invasion force . The only armour Malr had available in Eastern Slovakia were the 8 OA vz. 30 armoured cars and nine LT vz. 35 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Preov . However , once in Slovakia their embittered Czech crews had sabotaged all of them . As a result , none of them were immediately available when the fighting started on March 23. # VI Corps # ' ' Commander-in-Chief : Lieutenant-General Augustn Malr ' ' : * 16th Infantry Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * 20th Infantry Regiment : * 37th Infantry Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * 12th Artillery Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * 112th Artillery Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * Armoured Car Platoon ' ' ( 9 OA vz. 30 armoured cars ) ' ' : * Tank Platoon ' ' ( 3 LT vz. 35 light tanks ) ' ' # Air Force # : * 45th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * 49th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves with 10 Avia B-534 fighter aircraft ) ' ' : * 12th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves with 10 Letov -28 tactical reconnaissance aircraft and Aero AP-32 tactical reconnaissance aircraft ) ' ' : * 13th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves with 10 Letov -28 tactical reconnaissance aircraft and AP-32 tactical reconnaissance aircraft ) ' ' # Notes #  # Sources # * Axworthy , Mark W.A.
