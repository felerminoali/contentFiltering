lastaired = ' ' The Family ' ' is a reality television series that aired on ABC spanning one season in 2003 . It starred ten members from an Italian-American family , who were each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize . The show was hosted by George Hamilton . # Story # Ten family members from New York City were removed from their daily lives and moved into a mansion in Wellington , Florida . The house was fully furnished and came with a full staff of multiple maids , butlers , and a full cooking staff . Each week , the contestants played reward challenges and elimination contests . The elimination contests determined the two people who would be up for elimination from play . The elimination worked by gathering a secret Board of Trustees and making a decision on which member should be eliminated . The Board of Trustees , unbeknownst to the family itself , comprised the house 's maids , servants , and other workers . The Board usually chose to eliminate the family member who they felt was less deserving of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to remain in the house , but not allowed to participate in family activities . # Contestants # All the contestants were directly related , be they brother and sister , mother and father or cousin and second cousin . In the first part of the game , three contestants were eliminated . These three lost the elimination contest , and were rejected by the Board of Trustees . During the second phase of the game , more strategic plays were made by the remaining contestants to try to rid the contestant pool of the strongest threats . Three of the stronger contestants were eliminated in this phase . When the contestant pool was narrowed down to four , the challenges became physical and mental . Eventually one survived and made it to the end . The Board of Trustees had the final word on eliminations up to this point . When the final contestant remained , the eliminated family members were allowed to vote one of themselves back into the game for the final challenge . The eliminated contestants selected Anthony , the considered the wild , immature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected by the Board of Trustees , was Michael , considered by many to be the lovable family outcast . The winner of the final challenge was Anthony , who claimed the Million Dollar Prize . He was given the option of either keeping the money for himself , or splitting the prize equally between the ten members . After remaining in solitary confinement overnight to contemplate his choice , Anthony decided that he did n't deserve more money than anyone who played this game . He chose to split the money equally between the ten , and everyone received $100,000 each . # The Board of Trustees # In a twist , the Board of Trustees was , in fact , the household staff , consisting of the maid ( Linda Levis ) , butler ( Andrew Lowery ) , social secretary ( Ringo Allen ) , personal stylist ( Jill Swid ) and chef ( Franck Porcher ) . The family was surprised ( and some members became visibly upset ) to discover that , instead of being judged by business or society experts , they were being judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed their dishes . # Elimination Order # border= 2 cellpadding= 0 cellspacing= 0 # Critical reception # The Family received overwhelmingly negative reviews upon its debut in 2003 . The USA Today described the show as a tacky debacle , that ridiculed the family 's heritage , from the snobbish dismissal of their preference for Italian food . . . to the on-air logo that echoes the logo for The Godfather . The popular reception was just as poor , leading the series to be cancelled within one season . Ironically , Italian-American cultural critic George de Stefano credits this reality show , in lampooning the mores and lifestyles of East-coast urban Italian-Americans , as having paved the way for more successful yet similar programs such as Growing up Gotti and Jersey Shore .
