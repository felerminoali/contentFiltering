The tactical assault groups ( TAG ) are military counter-terrorism units in Australia . At present there are two tactical assault groups based on opposite sides of the country . As such they are individually identified as being either TAG East , based in Sydney or TAG West , based in Perth . Both groups are structured to conduct offensive domestic counter-terrorist operations focusing on direct action and hostage recovery . Each assault group maintains a short notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of State and Federal Police Tactical Groups . These aims are achieved through various highly specialised skill sets , niche capabilities and supporting Australian Defence Force ( ADF ) units such as those from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment and 171st Aviation Squadron . # History # The Sydney Hilton bombing on 13 February 1978 was the catalyst for the Commonwealth Government to initiate an urgent review of security procedures to combat the threat of international terrorism . The anti-terrorist agencies ( the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ) were placed on heightened alert and a Protective Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of a Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth State Cooperation for Protection against Violence , which would be primarily responsible for the coordination and funding of various organisations involved . He also directed that police forces around Australia absorb the counter-terrorist role . However , a study by Sir Robert Mark , at that time recently retired from the London Metropolitan Police , concluded that this was a task for ' sophisticated soldiery ' and should not be given to the police but rather to the Army . Sir Roberts advice was further strengthened by the Ironbark Report , written by Colonel John Essex-Clark , in which he advised the urgent formation of a special counter-terrorist force within the Army . In August 1978 , it was proposed to allocate the task of raising , training and sustaining the conter-terrorist force to the Special Air Service Regiment to follow similar lines from the British Army with their counter-terrorist team from within their SAS . The force was to be called the TAG and was to be commanded by the Commanding Officer SASR . On 3 May 1979 , the Government approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with final authorisation to raise the TAG given on 31 August 1979 . The tasks allocated to the group included : * The neutralisation , including capture , of terrorist groups , which might include snipers , hijackers , kidnappers , bombers or assassins , and the neutralisation of aircraft or ships ; * The recovery of hostages and property held by terrorists ; and * The recovery of buildings and installations held by terrorists . The training began officially in March 1980 and the force became fully operational in the following May . In July 1980 , the SASR was directed to develop an offshore ( maritime ) capability , concerned primarily with retaking Bass Strait oil rigs in the event of terrorist capture . These operations were to be handled by a dedicated water operations team which included 17 Navy personnel from the RANs Clearance Diving Teams , who were placed under operational control of the SASR from 4 August 1980 as part of the TAG . TAG ( East ) was raised on 22 July 2002 in order to increase the ADF 's domestic counter-terrorist capability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was redesignated TAG ( West ) . The dual basing enables the ADF to readily respond to simultaneous and geographically separate domestic incidents . # Organisation # At present there are two tactical assault groups , TAG East and TAG West . Each belongs to a different parent unit and each protect a different domestic geographical area of Australia . TAG East draws its members from the 2nd Commando Regiment , and rotates one company through the role for a pre-determined length of time . It is also supplemented with personnel from the Royal Australian Navy 's Clearance Diving Teams . The Royal Australian Navy component consists of an operations officer , a clearance diver ( CD ) assault platoon , one team of CD maritime snipers , and an underwater medic . Approximately 30 Clearance Divers are permanently attached to the group at any one time . TAG East provides the primary response to terrorism within Australia TAG West draws its members from the Special Air Service Regiment and rotates one squadron through the role for a pre-determined length of time . TAG West has primary responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil platforms , and also international/overseas incidents . Both have world-class training facilities including advanced outdoor close-quarters battle ranges , MOUT villages , urban CT complexes , full-size aircraft mock-ups , and sniper ranges . Both participate in NATEX ( national anti-terrorism exercises ) . Several times each year , exercises are conducted to test elements of the Australian Defence Force including the two tactical assault groups , Special Operations Command ( Australia ) and the Incident Response Regiment . The exercises also involve relevant components of state and territory police forces , such as police tactical groups and intelligence agencies such as ASIO . TAG-West conducts annual training courses for police tactical group members from each state and territory . Each year as part of the National Counter-Terrorist Committee Skills Enhancement Course , each state and territory sends several members of its PTG to participate in a concentrated three-week course to strengthen standards of policing in urban counter-terrorist tactics and ensure all states are training consistently to the same codes and standards of counter-terrorism. # Operations # * 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games : * 2000 Sydney Olympics Security : Joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 MV Tampa boarding : MV Tampa ( see Tampa affair ) . * 2003 Pong Su boarding : * 2003 Rugby World Cup : Operation Scrummage * 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games : Operation Acolyte * 2007 Sydney APEC Conference : Operation Deluge * 2008 World Youth Day Sydney and visit of Pope Benedict XVI : Operation Testament The Pong Su incident occurred during April 2003 when members of Special Operations Command ( Australia ) intercepted and boarded the Pong Su , a 4,000 ton North Korean ocean freighter in Australian territorial waters . The ship was flying the flag of Tuvalu at the time , known as flying a flag of convenience . The boarding of the freighter was carried out by members of both TAGs and the Incident Response Regiment whilst the ship was underway in rough seas . The reason for apprehending the ship was that it was suspected of being involved in smuggling almost 125 kg ( 300 pounds ) of heroin into Australia .
