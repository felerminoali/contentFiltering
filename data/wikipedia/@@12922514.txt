Hughes/ Thrall was musical project formed in 1982 by former Deep Purple and Trapeze bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes and guitarist journeyman Pat Thrall . # History # While Pat Thrall had spent the late 1970s and early 1980s making a name for himself by playing with the likes of Automatic Man and Pat Travers , former Deep Purple man Glenn Hughes recorded one solo album after the demise of Purple in 1976 entitled ' ' Play Me Out ' ' ; a record that focused more on his love of soul and funk rather than hard-rock . ' ' Play Me Out ' ' had limited success and Hughes had slipped off the musical map , save for a few guest appearances here and there . Hughes moved to Los Angeles to write with the intention of releasing new material . In 1981 , Thrall 's playing caught Hughes ' eye and the two formed a musical partnership . After a period of jamming and writing they started recording with producer Andy Johns ( who had previously worked with the likes of Led Zeppelin , Free and The Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ' ' Hughes/Thrall ' ' in August 1982 .

The touring band featured drummer Tommy Aldridge and keyboardist Jesse Harms. # Further collaborations # The pair recorded some demos for a proposed follow-up to the first album , but these never ended up being released and the album was scrapped . A few of these demos have surfaced over the years , but are of limited quality .

Hughes and Thrall did team up again in 1987 to record a track for the Tom Hanks-Dan Aykroyd comedy ' ' Dragnet ' ' . The song , City of Crime , featured Hanks and Aykroyd rapping the verses , while Hughes sang the chorus . It was released as a single and a promotional video was shot , which received heavy rotation on MTV . Two songs , You Were Always There and Devil in You , from the abandoned follow-up album were included on Hughes 1994 solo album ' ' From Now On ... ' ' ; although both were new recordings that did not feature Thralls playing . Thrall did , however perform on Hughes 1995 album ' ' Feel ' ' , playing guitar and keyboards on eight of the tracks and co-writing two of them .
