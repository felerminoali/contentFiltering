In August 1862 , Greene joined his father and brothers in joining the Thirteenth Wisconsin infantry of the Union Army .

With the aid of botanists Asa Gray of Cambridge and George Engelmann of St. Louis , Greene made preparations to study botany in the West . While in Colorado in 1871 , Greene renewed his spirituality and became both a botany teacher and a candidate for Episcopal priesthood , becoming ordained in 1873 . In February 1874 Greene assumed pastorship of a church in Vallejo , California , the beginning of many short stays with churches throughout the Southwest . During these travels , Greene continued collecting plants , making forays into Arizona , New Mexico , and Mexico . In 18761877 , while Greene was an episcopal priest in Yreka , California , he discovered the first specimens of ' ' Phlox hirsuta ' ' , a small flowering plant found only in that area .

While he was chair of the newly founded botany department , Greene was one of only three American representatives to the International Committee on Botanical Nomenclature and president of the Madison Botanical Congress .

While at the Smithsonian , Greene renewed contact with Fr . Julius Nieuwland , a professor of botany at the University of Notre Dame and a student from Greenes years at the Catholic University of America . Following the expiration of his agreement with the Smithsonian in 1915 , Greene moved to South Bend , Indiana along with his library and herbarium specimens . Greene returned to Washington in October to continue work on the Landmarks of Botanical History , Part 2 . Greene fell ill while in Washington and died in Providence hospital on November 10 , 1915 .
