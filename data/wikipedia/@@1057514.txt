George Henry Moore ( 1 March 1810 19 April 1870 ) was an Irish politician who served as Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Mayo in the Parliament of the United Kingdom . He was one of the founders of the Catholic Defence Association and a leader of the Independent Irish Party . He was also father of the writer George A. Moore and the politician Maurice George Moore . Their ancestral home , Moore Hall was burned down in 1923 by the anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War . # Public life # His grandfather John Moore had been appointed President of the short lived Republic of Connacht in the 1798 rebellion by General Humbert at Castlebar . The Independent Irish party was damaged by weak leaders and by the lack of support its received from the Roman Catholic Church . Charles Gavan Duffy left in despair and went to Australia . Frederick Lucas proved an ineffective leader , while his successor , George Henry Moore , its new leader , having got elected in his Mayo ( UK Parliament constituency ) The party split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into oblivion . Members of the group participated in the meeting of MPs in 1859 , which agreed to support the Second Palmerston Government and which is often regarded as the formal foundation of the Liberal Party . Moore contested aggressively against John Sadleir and William Keogh , former allies and friends whom he disowned , in elections upon many occasions , in various constituencies wherever they presented themselves , and at some expense after the two abandoned their principles and party to take British Government positions within the Irish administration . During the Irish potato famine Moore purchased livestock for his tenants ; cows were given to many and much grain was imported in bulk , and he encouraged tenants to grow alternative crops to the potato . None of his tenants starved , nor were any evicted . Full remission for any tenant paying 5 per year and 75% remission for those paying under 10 per annum were ordered . In June 1847 , a vessel the Martha Washington was requisitioned by Moore , the Marquess of Sligo and Sir Robert Lynch-Blosse . The ship was laden with 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayo , the cargo distributed among their tenants at a combined loss of 4819.0.6d . As the famine got worse Moore gave grazing lands to the people and placed others directly under his care on his own estate at Moore Hall . Speaking out in parliament for the Irish in the famine , Moore declared that disaster followed every scheme that Lord Trevelyan originated . Also at a meeting in Partry , again against the advice of his mother , he denounced angrily the idea that a few wandering fanatics and vagabond emissaries from England could extinguish the Catholic Church with Indian meal and soup , during the ' ' food for conversion ' ' schemes that followed in the footsteps of the famine . He was chairman of two famine relief committees , one at Ballintubber and secondly , at Partry both areas full of destitute people , who benefited from his donations . By the end of the famine Moore , and like-minded landowners , were broke . Bankruptcy followed , but Moore was able to buy back large tracts of his land . He had fought two scurrilous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of tenants and his character . Moore was a keen hunter and horse racer , noted for his well trained stud of hunters .. of reckless courage with which he rode them around Galway . Known as ' ' Dog ' ' Moore , after his well known horse Wolfdog he set up a series of wagers at race meetings including the Grand National , Tuam and Ballinrobe . His winnings , offset against betting against his own horses , netted him around 3,000,000 by today 's reckoning and these funds helped greatly feed his tenantry . He rode Tinderbox in the 1845 Grand National falling at the 10th . His own brother Augustus , with whom he recklessly hunted , was killed at the 1845 Aintree Grand National while riding Mickey Free the sire of Fenian ( winner of the Belmont stakes in 1869 ) , and this was said to be the turning point in George 's life whereby George gave himself completely to the benefit of the people of his estates . His other famous steeds were Coranna winner of the Chester Cup in 1846 whose portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Coranna , George sent 1000 to his tenantry for famine relief-Croaghpatrick was the winner of the Stewards Cup at Goodwood in 1861 . A more unusual horse was Faugh a Ballaghan ex-army steed of the Royal Irish Fusiliers with whom Moore wagered heavily with . A rather wretched looking mule with knock knees , it was able to clear high walls with little effort from a dawdling run up much to the amazement of everyone who witnessed it . His own greatest personal feat as a jockey was to win the New Melton stakes at Cahir . On land owned by the Marquis of Waterford at Ronscar Moore won on a ' ' shelly looking customer ' ' the bay gelding , Anonymous . This was said to be one of the greatest races ever run in Ireland , and the jumps included high and tall stone walls . The race was talked about for years after . Both this horse and The Don , another steeplechaser were killed soon after ; the former at Worcester racecourse in March 1843 and the latter at the Kings County ( Offaly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar blue birdseye jacket . Again Moore swore not to have anything to do with horseracing again after the death of these two beloved mounts , but the promise never held . Moore also helped in the organisation the construction of a monastery on Lough Mask near Tourmakeady beneath the mountain Tournasala with the cooperation of Archbishop MacHale and the local firebrand of Ballinrobe , the Reverend Peter Conway . In his youth George had been a worry to his parents least of all because of his gambling habits , and a failure to conclude a formal private education , preferring to pursue an alternative education in billiards at which he became expert , and all the fun that the cities of Bath and London had to offer a young Georgian-era male . However Moore Hall was a teetotal manor , so drinking at least , was off limits as the Moore family never partook of alcohol . He was a writer of very frank open letters to friends of his mother , and his ' ' enemies ' ' , of which he gathered many , owing to high temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady friends , telling them exactly what he thought . In his youth he had travelled the Arab World including Syria . Moore attempted at least to challenge to a duelling at least two men in his youth ; local landowner Joe Mr Mac Dhonnaill of Doo or Dubh Castle , for insulting George Moore senior , and O'Gorman Mahon who later became a parliamentary member with the Irish party and the oldest member of the house in his day . Both perhaps wisely declined , though the latter later fought in Latin America . Moore was a member of the Fenian Brotherhood but was a strong advocate of friendship with the Orange Lodge . Among visitors to Moorehall in Mayo were O'Donovan Rossa and John O'Connor Power , the representative for Connacht on the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood . He died on 19 April 1870 , at Moore Hall ; he was succeeded by his brother-in-law , George Ekins Browne . His oration was read by the Land League priest , Father Lavelle , and his coffin borne to Carnacon Church by 16 of his tenants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass . The interment took place at Kiltoom. # Notes # # References #
