Although Kubica passed the medical examination and did not seem to show any ill effects , the FIA medical delegate decided it would be best to rest him for the weekend , and not risk a second impact at the circuit so famous for its high speed crashes . This was a precautionary measure another concussion so close to the previous one could be dangerous . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series championship leader , 19-year-old German Sebastian Vettel , who made his Formula One debut at the Indianapolis circuit . # Practice # Friday 's morning practice was dominated by McLaren and BMW Sauber , with Fernando Alonso putting in the fastest time .

His partner , Mark Webber , was close behind followed by the Spyker and Williams cars . Later in the session , with about six minutes left , Coulthard spun out in turn eight . Fernando Alonso ran first , Nick Heidfeld second , and Lewis Hamilton closely behind in third . Although they struggled , both Ferraris made it , as well as Vettel . Scott Speed failed to make it out of Q1 in his native country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takuma Sato , Alexander Wurz , and Christijan Albers also missed the cut .

In part three Hamilton was first out and set the quickest time with a 1:13:089 . Alonso was about four tenths behind , followed by Heidfeld and the Ferraris . Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen , both Renault drivers , also were near the top , but Jarno Trulli and Webber knocked Fisichella down . With about 5 minutes left , Massa took first spot and Rikknen took second . Hamilton was bumped to third , Alonso fourth , and Heidfeld remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top spot , and Alonso second .
