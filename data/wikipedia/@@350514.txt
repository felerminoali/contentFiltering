Andover is a town in the English county of Hampshire . The town is on the River Anton some 18.5 miles ( 30 km ) west of the town of Basingstoke , 18.5 miles ( 30 km ) north-west of the city of Winchester and 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of the city of Southampton . Andover is twinned with the towns of Redon in France , Goch in Germany , and Andover , Massachusetts in the United States . # History # # Early history # Its name is recorded in Anglo-Saxon in 955 AD as ' ' Andeferas ' ' , and is thought to be of Celtic origin : compare Welsh ' ' onn dwfr ' ' = ash(tree) water . Andover 's first mention in history is in 950 when King Edred is recorded as having built a royal hunting lodge there . In 962 King Edgar called a meeting of the Saxon ' parliament ' ( the Witenagemot ) at his hunting lodge near Andover . Of more importance was the baptism , in 994 of a Viking king named Olaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of that man was either Olav Trygvason or Olof Sktkonung . The baptism was part of a deal with King Ethelred II of England ( The Unready ) whereby he stopped ravaging England and returned home . Olav Tryggvason became king of Norway in 995 and tried to convert his country to Christianity before his death in battle in 1000 . Olof Sktkonung was already king of Sweden and became its first Christian king and began c. 995 to mint Sweden 's first coins with the help of English expertise . At the time of the Domesday Book ( 1086 ) Andover had 107 male inhabitants and probably had a total population of about 500 . It was quite a large settlement by the standards of the time . ( Most villages had only 100 to 150 people ) . Andover also had 6 watermills which ground grain to flour . In 1175 King Richard I sold Andover a charter granting the townspeople certain rights , forming a merchant guild which took over the government of the town . The members elected two officials called bailiffs who ran the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect royal taxes in Andover themselves . In 1256 Henry III gave the townspeople the right to hold a court and try criminals for offences committed in Andover . Andover also sent MPs to the parliaments of 1295 and 1302-1307 . The town was ravaged by two serious fires , one in 1141 and another in 1435 . Andover remained a small market town . Processing wool appears to have been the main industry and street names in the area of the town known as Sheep Fair commemorate this . A weekly market , and an annual fair were held . As well as the Church of St Mary the town had a priory and a hospital run by monks , dedicated to St John the Baptist , and also a lepers hostel to St Mary Magdalene . In 1538 during the Reformation Henry VIII closed the priory and the hospital . In 1571 a free school for the boys of Andover was established . This in time became Andover Grammar School , and is now John Hanson Community School . ( Which has since been demolished and rebuilt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site which was once John Hanson , now acts as a housing district . ) In 1599 the town received a new charter from Elizabeth I. The merchants guild was made a corporation and the number of annual fairs was increased from one to three . Like other towns Andover suffered from outbreaks of plague . There were outbreaks in 1603-5 , 1625-6 and 1636. # 18th and 19th century # During the 18th century , being situated on the main Exeter Salisbury London road Andover became a major stopping point on the stagecoach routes , more than 30 stagecoaches passing through the town each day . In 1789 a canal to Southampton was opened , though this was never a commercial success and closed in 1859 . In 1836 the Borough established a small police force , although this was for the most part just two constables and a gaoler . Andover was linked to Basingstoke and thus to London by railway when the Andover junction station was opened on 3 July 1854 ; this railway also linking the town to Salisbury . The town was also linked by railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this was closed down in 1964 . The land , together with the adjacent gasworks and P. M. Coombes woodyards , was then sold to the TSB Trust Company who later built their headquarters there . The population grew from 3,304 in 1801 to 5,501 in 1871 . During the 19th century the town acquired all the usual additions , a theatre in 1803 , gas street lighting in 1838 , a fire station and cottage hospital in 1877 , a swimming pool opened in 1885 and a recreation ground opened in 1887 . A water company was formed in 1875 to provide piped water to the town and a system of sewers and drains was built in 1899-1902 . The public library opened in 1897 . Despite this burgeoning of the amenities of the town in 1845 a notorious scandal involving the hardships endured by the inmates of the workhouse led indirectly to reform of the Poor Law Act . The town was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Reform Act 1835 . In 1846 , the town came to public attention after an enquiry exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to light evidence of beatings , sexual abuse and general mistreatment of workhouse inmates by the overseers . The woollen industry had declined but new industries took its place . Taskers Waterloo Ironworks opened at Anna Valley in 1809 and flourished . Many examples of the machinery produced by Taskers can be seen at the Milestones Museum in Basingstoke . # Modern history # # #Employment# # The town 's largest employer is the Ministry of Defence . RAF Andover was opened on Andover Airfield , to the south of the town , during the First World War and became the site of the RAF Staff College . In 1932 Andover gained a new industry when the printers for Kelly 's Directory moved to the town . Slowly the town grew from about 11,000 and by 1960 had a population of about 17,000 , because already some Londoners were being housed in the first of the council houses/flats being constructed . During the Second World War the RAF Staff College was the headquarters of RAF Maintenance Command , and gained a unique place in British history , as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed in January 1945 at RAF Andover . The airfield is no longer in use although the RAF retains a link to the area through the presence of 1213 ( Andover ) Squadron , Air Training Corps . When the RAF left the site became the Headquarters of the Quartermaster General and later Logistics Executive ( Army ) . In 2001 , the Defence Logistics Organisation ( DLO ) was formed and Andover became one of its major sites . Since 2012 , the site has been the home of Army Headquarters . The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre is based locally at Amport House , as is the Army Air Corps Centre and the Museum of Army Flying at Middle Wallop . Major industries include Twinings the tea and coffee firm , Ducal Pine Furniture ( until they closed in 2003 ) , Thomson International Publishers , who produce the Pitkin Guides to be found in many churches and other notable buildings , financial institutions such as Simplyhealth and Lloyds Banking Group , and the Stannah Group , whose HQ is also in the town . Unemployment is very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the council 's Borough Local Plan 2006 are plans to develop the former site of RAF Andover to Class B1 , B2 and B8 uses . # #Politics# # Andover is in the constituency of North West Hampshire , represented in the House of Commons since 1997 by Sir George Young , a Conservative . In 1951 the Town Council decided it would be a good idea to add fluoride to the drinking water to improve dental health . This provoked a furious public response , and a strong anti-fluoridation campaign started . In the 1958 local elections anti-fluoridation candidates swept the board , turning out many established members , and the idea was dropped . In 1950s the Borough Council was approached by the Greater London Council to become an overspill town , to build houses and take people and industry relocated from the overcrowded capital . Some contend that had the old Borough Council still been in charge this would never have been agreed . But it was , and in 1961 the plan was drawn up to expand to a population of some 47,000 by 1982 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new council houses were ready by 1954 and by 1981 the population had risen to 51,000 . A bypass , industrial estates and a new shopping centre in the town centre , called the Chantry Centre , were all built and the towns character changed completely . The new council houses proved to be very badly built . It seemed that the local council would have to foot the enormous bill for reconstruction , but after starting legal action against the Greater London Council a settlement was achieved , in which the GLC paid a large sum of money to the local council , which started a programme of refurbishment that finished in 1995 . The Borough Council and Andover Rural District Council were abolished in the local government reorganisation of 1974 , and replaced by Test Valley Borough Council , which included the land down to the edge of Southampton in the south , quite a rural area apart from Andover .

The new owners , Anthony and Sarah de Sigley , restored the building in 2003 , rebuilding much of the original structure . # Climate # Andover , in common with much of the UK , experiences a maritime climate type , reflected in its limited temperature range and lack of rainy/dry seasons , although rainfall does tend to peak in winter and reach a minimum in summer .
