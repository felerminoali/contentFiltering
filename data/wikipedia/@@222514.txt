deathplace = Lil Hardin Armstrong ( February 3 , 1898 August 27 , 1971 ) was a jazz pianist , composer , arranger , singer , and bandleader , and the second wife of Louis Armstrong with whom she collaborated on many recordings in the 1920s . Hardin 's compositions include Struttin ' With Some Barbecue , Do n't Jive Me , Two Deuces , Knee Drops , Doin ' the Suzie-Q , Just For a Thrill ( which became a major hit when revived by Ray Charles in 1959 ) , Clip Joint , and Bad Boy ( a minor hit for Ringo Starr in 1978 ) , her composition Oriental Swing was sampled heavily to create Parov Stelar 's 2012 retro-song Booty Swing , which in turn gained notoriety when it was used in a 2013 Chevrolet commercial . # Background # She was born as Lillian Hardin in Memphis , Tennessee , where she grew up in a household with her grandmother , Priscilla Martin , a former slave from near Oxford , Mississippi . During her early years , Hardin was taught hymns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to popular music and later blues , but could only listen to or play these styles occasionally and covertly , because her mother , Dempsey ( Lil called her Decie ) , a deeply religious woman , considered them sinful . # Early education and mentors # Hardin first received piano instruction from her third grade teacher , Miss Violet White , then her mother enrolled her in Mrs. Hook 's School of Music . I later learned that they had taught me all the wrong things , Hardin recalled in 1971 , but they meant well . It was at Fisk University , a college for African Americans located in downtown Nashville , that Hardin was taught a more acceptable approach to the instrument . Hardin stayed at the school for one year , returning to Memphis in 1917 . In August 1918 , she moved to Chicago with her mother and stepfather . By then , she had become proficient in reading music , a skill that landed her a job as a sheet music demonstrator at Jones Music Store . The proprietor , Jennie Jones , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers to the store . A visit by Jelly Roll Morton would profoundly affect Hardin 's musical education . He sat down , she wrote in her unpublished biography , the piano rocked , the floor shivered , the people swayed while he attacked the keyboard with his long skinny fingers , beating out a double rhythm with his feet on the loud pedal . Oh , was I thrilled and amazed . He finally got up from the piano , grinned and looked at me as if to say , ' Let this be a lesson to you . ' Well it was a lesson . When a small crowd urged Hardin to play something for Morton , she did . I laid Witches Dance and Rachmaninoff 's Prelude in C Sharp Minor on him . Morton 's visit had a profound effect on Hardin , who began embellishing the sheet music with her own ideas , much to the delight of customers . She had been on the job for three weeks when clarinetist Lawrence Duh 's New Orleans Creole Jazz Band came in for an audition . Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardin there when Duh was asked to add a pianist . I did my best to be a miniature Jelly Roll Morton , she said , and Duh decided to keep me . The store had been paying Hardin $3 a week , but Duh offered $22.50 . Knowing that her mother would not approve of her working in a cabaret , she made it known that her new job was playing for a dancing school . Three weeks later , the band moved on to a better booking at the De Luxe Caf , where the entertainers included Florence Mills and Cora Green . From there , the band moved up to the jewel of Chicago 's night life , the Dreamland . Here the principal entertainers were Alberta Hunter and Ollie Powers , and there was no finer night spot in Chicago . When King Oliver 's Creole Jazz Band replaced Duh 's group at the Dreamland , Oliver asked Hardin to stay with him . She was with Oliver at the Dreamland in 1921 , when an offer came for the orchestra to play a six-month engagement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that booking , Hardin returned to Chicago while the rest of the Oliver band went on to Los Angeles . # Marriages and divorces # In Chicago , Hardin went back to work at the Dreamland , as pianist in an orchestra for Mae Brady , a violinist and vaudeville stalwart . While there , she fell for Jimmie Johnson , a young singer from Washington , D.C. , whom she married on August 22 , 1922 . The marriage was short-lived , ending in divorce . In the meantime , the Oliver band returned from California and opened at the Royal Gardens , with Bertha Gonzales at the piano , but soon found itself back at the Dreamland , with Hardin at the piano . His band was enjoying enormous success at the Dreamland when King Oliver sent for Louis Armstrong to join as second cornetist . Armstrong was beginning to make a name for himself in their hometown , New Orleans , and regarded Oliver ( Papa Joe ) as his mentor . Some say that Oliver saw Louis as a threat to his jazz throne and decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containment , although by all accounts both cornetists enjoyed working together . At first , Hardin was unimpressed with Louis , who arrived in Chicago wearing clothes and a hair style that she deemed to be too country for Chicago , but she worked to take the country out of him and a romance developed ( to the surprise of other band members , some of whom had been trying to woo pretty Hardin for some time with no success ) . She already had divorce experience and helped Louis get a divorce from his first wife Daisy , from whom he had separated back in New Orleans . Hardin and Louis were married on February 4 , 1924 . Hardin took Louis shopping and taught him how to dress more fashionablyshe also got rid of his bangs , and began working on his career . Recognizing his extraordinary talent , she felt that he was wasting it in a secondary role . Louis was happy to be playing next to his idol , but Hardin eventually persuaded him to leave Oliver and go it on his own . Armstrong eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accepted a job with Fletcher Henderson in New York City . Hardin stayed in Chicago , first with Oliver , then leading a band of her own . When Hardin 's band got a job at the Dreamland Caf in Chicago , the following year , she prepared for Louis ' return to Chicago by having a huge banner made to advertise him as The World 's Greatest Trumpet Player . Louis was gaining an impressive reputation when Richard M. Jones convinced Okeh Records to make a series of sessions under his name : the classic Armstrong Hot Five recordings . With Hardin at the piano , Kid Ory on trombone , Johnny Dodds on clarinet , and Johnny St. Cyr on banjo , this stellar group rehearsed at Louis and Hardin 's residence on Chicago 's East 41st Street and held its first session on November 15 , 1925 . Few recordings are as celebrated as the ones made by the Hot Five ( and , sometimes , with Earl Hines replacing Hardin , the Hot Seven ) between then and the end of 1928 . Hardin had actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in April and May 1926 . She also recorded a session for Columbia Records as the New Orleans Wanderers . In the late 1920s Hardin and Louis grew apart . Armstrong formed a new Hot Five , with Earl Hines on piano . Hardin reformed her own band with Freddie Keppard on cornet ( whom Hardin considered second only to Louis ) . Louis and Hardin separated in 1931 , when he had begun a liaison with Alpha Smith , who threatened to sue Armstrong for breach of promise , so he begged Hardin not to grant him a divorce . I felt sorry for Louis , Hardin later recalled , but he had two-timed me , so I gave him a divorce just to teach him a lessonand I sued him , too . # Later years # In the 1930s , sometimes billing herself as Mrs. Louis Armstrong , Hardin led an All Girl Orchestra , then a mixed gender Big Band which broadcast nationally over the NBC radio network . The same decade she recorded a series of sides for Decca Records as a Swing ( genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1950s , Hardin worked mostly as a soloist singing and playing piano . In the late 1940s , she decided to leave the music and become a tailor , so she took a course in tailoring . Her graduation project was to make a tuxedo for Louis . It was displayed prominently at a New York cocktail party she threw to announce her new field of endeavor . They looked at Louis ' tux and all the other things I had made and they were very impressed , she recalled , but then someone asked me to play the piano . That 's when I knew that I would never be able to leave the music business . Louis wore Hardin 's tuxedo and she continued to tailor , but only as a sideline and then only for friends . Her shirts , which friends received regularly on birthdays , proudly bore a label with her mother 's name , Decie , and beneath that , Hand made by Lil Armstrong . Hardin eventually returned to Chicago and the house on East 41st Street . She also made a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but mostly she worked around Chicago , often with fellow Chicagoans . Collaborators included Red Saunders , Joe Williams , Oscar Brown , Jr. , and Little Brother Montgomery . In the 1950s , Hardin recorded a biographical narrative for Riverside 's Bill Grauer , which was issued in LP form . She would again appear on that label in 1961 , participating in its Chicago : The Living Legends project as accompanist for Alberta Hunter and leader of her own hastily assembled big band . At that time , her favorite living pianists were Thelonious Monk and Billy Taylor , which helps to explain why , when Riverside producer Chris Albertson approached her about these recordings , her immediate reaction was , Who 's going to listen to that old stuff ? The Riverside recordings led to her inclusion in a star-studded 1961 NBC network special , Chicago and All That Jazz , and a follow-up album released through the Verve Records imprint . In 1962 , Hardin began writing her autobiography , in collaboration with Albertson , but she had second thoughts when she realized that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might discomfit Louis Armstrong , so the project was shelved with only five chapters written . # Death # When Armstrong died , in 1971 , Hardin was deeply shaken by the loss . She traveled to New York for the funeral and rode in the family car . I think Louis would have found a way getting back at me if I had n't put Hardin in that car , his widow , Lucille , told Albertson . Returning to Chicago , Hardin felt that work on her autobiography could now continue , but the following month , performing at a televised memorial concert for Louis , Lil Hardin Armstrong collapsed at the piano . She died an hour later , aged 73.
