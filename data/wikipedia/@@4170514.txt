The Jindabyne pumping station pumps the water from the rivers into the Snowy-Murray tunnel where it flows west through Murray 1 and Murray 2 Power Stations before entering the Swampy Plains River and then the Murray River . The flow of water into Lake Jindabyne is particularly strong during the spring months of October and November . The idea of the Snowy Mountains Scheme was developed in the 1940s as a way of increasing the flow of inland rivers in order to encourage the development of primary industries based on irrigation . After the Lake was built , the flow of water into the Snowy River was only 1% of the amount that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the state of the lower reaches of the Snowy River in Victoria and NSW .
