Laury Silvers of Skidmore College , who read the manuscript , wrote at progressiveislam.org : #  Do n't miss the self-disgust . I have read the whole novel . It is extraordinary . The best he has done yet . It is no mistake that his only woman character who was ever fully portrayed and whom he never saw because of her burqa cuts his head off in the end .
