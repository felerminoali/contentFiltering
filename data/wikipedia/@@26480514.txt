Point Lonsdale Lighthouse , also known as the Point Lonsdale Signal Station , is close to the township of Point Lonsdale in the Borough of Queenscliffe , Victoria , Australia . It stands at the eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula , on the western side of the entrance to Port Phillip from Bass Strait , on a headland overlooking the Rip , a stretch of water considered one of the ten most treacherous navigable passages in the world , and the only seaborne approach to Melbourne . It is operated by the Victorian Channels Authority , part of the Port of Melbourne Corporation . # Description # The lighthouse was designed by the Victorian Public Works Department and erected by the contractors Coates Brothers . It is of a traditional design consisting of a cylindrical tower and capital , similar to many late nineteenth century Victorian lighthouses , such as the earlier Point Hicks Lighthouse . It is built of reinforced concrete and surmounted by a Chance Brothers lantern . The original oil lamp of the light was first replaced with an acetylene light and later an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-storey , brick signal station and observation room . Halfway up the tower is a cantilevered platform supporting red and green navigation lights . # History # The first navigation aid at Point Lonsdale was a signal station erected in 1852 . In 1856 a red pillar beacon was built . In 1863 the original Queenscliff Low Light , a prefabricated wooden structure , was re-erected at Point Lonsdale and painted with distinctive black and red bands . It used a temporary light until a permanent light was lit in 1867 . It was replaced by the current concrete tower in 1902 , with the wooden tower dismantled and cut up for firewood in 1912 . Responsibility for the light passed in 1915 from the state of Victoria to Commonwealth control . It was handed back in 1934 with the lighthouse classified as a Harbour Entrance Light rather than a Coastal Highway Light . The signal station and observation room were added to the base of the tower in 1950 . Although the light was automated in 1999 , the signal station continues to be staffed 24 hours a day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and inside Port Phillip Heads , making it possibly the last manned lighthouse in Australia . # Heritage values # The Point Lonsdale Lighthouse precinct contains not only the lighthouse itself , but other buildings associated with lighthouse operations and navigation , as well as nearby military defence structures built during the First and Second World Wars . The whole precinct is considered to be of architectural , historical and archaeological significance to the State of Victoria , and has been listed by Heritage Victoria with the Victorian Heritage Database number H1517 . It is of historical significance because of its association with the maritime and defence history of the state . The lighthouse structures in the precinct show the importance of navigational aids at a time when shipping was vitally important in maintaining trade between Victorian ports and the rest of the world . The lighthouse was the first guiding light to the entrance of Port Phillip visible from the sea . The defence structures reflect the importance of the defence of Port Phillip and its major cities of Melbourne and Geelong during the two World Wars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884 and an explosives shed ( later used as a rocket shed ) built in 1891 , are of architectural significance . The lighthouse is a typical and aesthetically pleasing example of an early 20th-century lighthouse design . The foghorn shed is the only one known from a Victorian lighthouse , and the two vertical boilers which power the steam operated foghorns are rare in their original setting . The precinct is of archaeological significance for its potential to reveal artefactual remains pertaining to the use of the site as a lightstation and signal station . # The lighthouse today # The lighthouses exterior was restored in 1997 and , in 2002 , Heritage Victoria and the Victorian Channels Authority cooperated to restore the interior . Celebrations of the structure 's centenary were held on 23 March 2002 . It contains a restored foghorn which is operated in foggy weather , giving a double blast every 30 seconds . There is public access to the area around the tower . Organised tours of the tower are conducted on Sundays by the Queenscliffe Maritime Museum .
