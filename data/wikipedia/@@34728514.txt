NACA Report No. 964 - The effects of variations in Reynolds number between 3.0 x 10  6  and 25.0 x 10  6  upon the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of NACA 6-series airfoil sections was published by the United States National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1950 . It contained a series of graphs showing the resulting lift and drag of several NACA 6-series airfoil sections from tests performed in a variable-density wind tunnel , in which the Reynolds number ( RN ) was set at three different values . # Summary # Results are presented of an investigation made to determine the two-dimensional lift and drag characteristics of nine NACA 6-series airfoil sections at RN of 15.0 , 20.0 , and 25.0 million . Also presented are data from NACA Rep. 824 for the same airfoils at RN of 3.0 , 6.0 , and 9.0 million . The airfoils selected represent sections having variations in the airfoil thickness , thickness form , and camber . The characteristics of an airfoil with a split flap were determined in one instance , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow behavior are advanced for the observed types of scale effect . # Introduction # Two-dimensional aerodynamic data obtained at RN of 3.0 , 6.0 and 9.0 million are now generally available for a large number of systematically derived NACA airfoil sections . This range of RN is sufficient to satisfy engineering needs for many practical applications , but the recent trends toward both very large and very high-speed aircraft have emphasized the necessity for aerodynamic data at higher values . An investigation has accordingly been made of the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of systematically varied NACA 6-series airfoils at RN of 15.0 , 20.0 and 25.0 million . The results of this investigation at high RN together with those for the same airfoils at lower RN are presented in Report No. 964 . The NACA 63 series was chosen as the basic group for investigation because these airfoils appear to offer good low-speed characteristics with a minimum of compromise from consideration of the high-speed characteristics . In all cases , only lift and drag were measured . # Apparatus # All the tests were made in the Langley two-dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures 3 x 7.5 feet , and the model completely spanned the 3-foot dimension . Seals were installed between the ends of the model and the tunnel walls to prevent air leakage . # Test results # # Drag # The reaction of the minimum drag coefficient of smooth airfoils to increasing RN is attributed to the relative strengths of two interacting boundary-layer changes . A thinning of the boundary layer with increasing RN gives a gradual decrease of minimum drag . As the RN is increased beyond a certain value , however , the transition point begins to move forward and the drag increases . The flow conditions of the thicker airfoils are more favorable for delaying the forward movement of transition . The addition of standard roughness to the NACA 63-009 section causes a large increase in the minimum drag at all RN , but increasing the RN has a favorable effect in reducing the drag . Increasing the RN from 9.0 to 15.0 million resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the low-drag range of all the airfoils except that of 18% thickness . # Lift # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no variation with RN . Throughout the range of RN of this investigation , the values of the lift-curve slope for the smooth sections are very close to that predicted by thin-airfoil theory ( 2 per radian , or 0.110 per degree ) . The effects of increasing RN on the maximum lift showed two general trends : for airfoils of 12% thickness or less , the maximum lift remains relatively constant over the lower range of RN . Increasing the RN , however , causes a rapid increase in maximum lift ; the 18% thick airfoils demonstrated a steady increase of maximum lift as RN is increased . # Concluding remarks # The 18% thick section had a type of maximum-lift variation with the RN that was entirely different from the thinner sections . Any comparison of airfoil maximum-lift characteristics can be made only if the data for the group of airfoils under consideration are available at the same RN . The choice of an optimum airfoil for maximum lift for a given applcation must be determined from data corresponding to the operating RN of the application .
