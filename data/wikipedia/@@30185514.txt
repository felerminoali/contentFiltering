birthplace = Hampshire , England deathplace = Canynge Road , Clifton , Bristol , England * Writtle College * University of Gloucestershire Joanna Clare Jo Yeates ( 19 April 1985 17 December 2010 ) was a 25-year-old landscape architect from Hampshire , England , who went missing on 17 December 2010 in Bristol after an evening out with colleagues . Following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries , her body was discovered on 25 December 2010 in Failand , North Somerset . A post-mortem examination determined that she had been strangled . The murder inquiry , named Operation Braid , was one of the largest police investigations ever undertaken in the Bristol area . The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates ' family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences . Rewards amounting to 60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates ' death . The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies , Yeates ' landlord , who lived in a flat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 32-year-old Dutch engineer and neighbour of Yeates , was arrested on 20 January 2011 . Media attention at the time centred on the filming of a re-enactment of her disappearance for the BBC 's programme , ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . After two days of questioning , he was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates ' murder . On 5 May 2011 , Tabak pleaded guilty to Yeates ' manslaughter , but denied murdering her . His trial started on 4 October 2011 ; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011 , and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years . The nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to the instigation of legal proceedings against a number of UK newspapers . Libel action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest , resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages . The ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' and ' ' The Sun ' ' were found guilty of contempt of court for reporting information that could prejudice a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish church in the Bristol suburb where she lived ; her funeral took place near the family home in Hampshire . Several memorials were planned , including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in Bristol . # Background and disappearance # Joanna Clare Yeates was born on 19 April 1985 to David and Teresa Yeates in Hampshire , England . She was privately educated at Embley Park near Romsey . Yeates studied for her A-levels at Peter Symonds College and graduated with a degree in landscape architecture from Writtle College . She received her Postgraduate diploma in landscape architecture from the University of Gloucestershire . In December 2008 , Yeates met then-25-year-old fellow landscape architect Greg Reardon at the firm Hyland Edgar Driver in Winchester . The couple moved in together in 2009 and settled in Clifton , Bristol , when the company relocated to that area . Yeates later changed jobs to work at the Building Design Partnership in Bristol . At approximately 8:00 pm on 19 December 2010 , Reardon returned home from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to contact her by phone and text , but did not find it .. completely out of character .. that she did not respond . While awaiting Yeates ' return , Reardon found that her purse and keys were at the flat , and that their cat appeared to have been neglected . After he called her again , her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat , which was still in the flat . Around midnight , Reardon contacted the police and then Yeates ' parents to report her missing . Investigators subsequently pieced together the sequence of events leading up to her disappearance . They determined Yeates had spent the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street , leaving at around 8:00 pm to begin the 20-minute walk home . She told friends and colleagues that she was looking forward to spending the weekend alone ; she planned to spend her time baking and shopping for Christmas . Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television ( CCTV ) at around 8:10 pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 8:30 pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve . The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40 pm . She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-license , Bargain Booze . # Search , public appeal , and discovery of body # Reardon and Yeates ' friends set up a website and used social networking services to help look for her . On 21 December 2010 , Yeates ' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference . In another press conference , broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News , Yeates ' father David commented on her disappearance : I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat .. I have no idea of the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind .. I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere . Her keys , phone , purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieved a receipt for a pizza , but found no sign of it or of its packaging . Both bottles of cider were found in the flat , one of them partially consumed . As there was no evidence of forced entry or a struggle , investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor . On 25 December 2010 , a fully clothed body was found in the snow by a couple walking their dogs along Longwood Lane near a golf course and next to the entrance of a quarry in Failand , approximately from her home . The body was identified by police as that of Yeates . Reardon and the Yeates family visited the site of the discovery on 27 December 2010 . David Yeates said that the family had been told to prepare for the worst and expressed relief that his daughter 's body had been recovered . Funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators wished to retain the body for a while . The pathologist Dr Nat Carey consented to the release of the body on 31 January 2011. # Investigation # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian staff under the direction of Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones , a senior officer with Avon and Somerset Constabulary 's major crime investigation unit . It became one of the largest police operations in the Constabulary 's history . Jones urged the public to come forward with any information to help catch the killer , especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of Longwood Lane in Failand in the period before Yeates ' body was discovered . He stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a light-coloured 4x4 vehicle for questioning . Jones said that officers had been .. inundated with thousands of calls .. and were .. exhausting every lead and avenue that they were provided with . Police examined over 100 hours of surveillance footage along with 293 t of rubbish seized from the area around Yeates ' flat . Crime Stoppers offered a 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her murderer , while ' ' The Sun ' ' newspaper offered 50,000 . Authorities advised people living in the area to secure their homes , and warned women not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the murder investigation Yeates ' father said , I fear that whoever has done this will never hand themselves in , but we live in hope that the police will catch who is responsible . # Post-mortem and initial enquiries # Following the discovery of Yeates ' body , detectives from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary issued an appeal for anyone with information about the death to come forward , and investigated similarities with other unsolved cases . Of particular interest to them were those of 20-year-old Glenis Carruthers who was strangled in 1974 , Melanie Hall , aged 25 , who disappeared in 1996 and whose body was discovered thirteen years later , and 35-year-old Claudia Lawrence who went missing in 2009 . Investigators identified striking similarities between the Yeates and Hall cases , notably their age and appearance , and that they had disappeared after returning home from meeting friends , but the possibility of such connections was later downplayed by authorities . The police gathered surveillance video from Clifton Suspension Bridge , which forms part of the most direct route from the crime scene to the Clifton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of poor quality , making it impossible to clearly distinguish individuals or car registration numbers . Investigators were aware that the perpetrator could have used an alternative bridge across the River Avon less than a mile to the south to avoid CCTV coverage . A post-mortem examination began on 26 December 2010 , though results were delayed due to the frozen condition of the body . Police initially thought it possible that Yeates froze to death because her body showed no visible signs of injury . Investigators announced on 28 December 2010 that the case had become a murder inquiry as the coroner determined that Yeates had died as a result of strangulation . The post-mortem indicated that she had died .. several days before being discovered on 25 December 2010 . The examination also confirmed that Yeates did not eat the pizza she had purchased . Detective Chief Inspector Jones stated that the investigation found .. no evidence to suggest that Joanna was sexually assaulted . The police searched Reardon 's laptop computer and mobile phone as part of standard procedure . Reardon was ruled out as a suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party at a neighbouring house on Canynge Road on the night of Yeates ' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00 pm coming from the direction of Yeates ' flat . Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates ' home said that he heard a high-pitched woman 's voice scream Help me . Officers removed the front door to Yeates ' flat to check for clothing fibres and DNA evidence , with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home . # Further enquiries # Senior officers from the investigation asked for assistance from the National Policing Improvement Agency , which provides expertise for difficult cases . On 4 January 2011 , a clinical forensic psychologist , who had previously been involved as a criminal profiler in other high profile murder cases , joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects . Jones stated that his officers had established over 1,000 lines of inquiry . Jones said , I can assure you , we are determined to solve this crime and bring Jo 's killers to justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Yeates ' socks was missing when she was found dead and that it had not been found at the crime scene or in her home . Police launched a national advertising campaign to appeal for witnesses through Facebook . The page , established on 4 January , had been viewed nearly 250,000 times by the following day , while CCTV footage of Yeates had been viewed 120,000 times on YouTube by 5 January . On 9 January 2011 , Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy gave her support to the idea of a public DNA screening process if the police found it useful . The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of then-18-year-old Louise Smith . McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area . DNA that had been found on Yeates ' body was tested for a potential profile . Detectives liaised with officials from the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements ( MAPPA ) , which manages individuals convicted of violent and sexual offences , with a view to interviewing registered sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crime # Shortly after 7.00 am on 30 December 2010 , Christopher Jefferies , Yeates ' landlord who lived in the same building , was arrested on suspicion of her murder . He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat . On 31 December , a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest , enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning . Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January . Investigators were able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours , but released Jefferies on bail after two days . He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf . On 4 March 2011 , police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect . He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest , and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case was filmed on location in Bristol for broadcast in the 26 January edition of the BBC television programme ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . A firm that had been involved in the production of the ' ' Harry Potter ' ' films was contracted to reproduce the snowy conditions at the time of Yeates ' disappearance . The reconstruction of Yeates ' last movements was filmed on 18 January , and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production , over 300 people contacted the police . A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates ' body may have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase . On the morning of 20 January , the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak , who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates . However , authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies ' arrest , which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested . The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal by Yeates ' parents on ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates ' home ; and officers sealed off Tabak 's adjacent flat . Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend , where Tabak was believed to have been staying , about a mile away . Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation , and had returned to England from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands . Following Tabak 's arrest , the BBC cancelled its plans to air the Yeates re-enactment on ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . On 31 January , previously unseen photos of Yeates were released through the programme 's website. # DNA tests # DNA tests were carried out by LGC Forensics , a private company which undertakes forensic analysis for criminal investigations . Lindsey Lennen , a body fluids and DNA specialist member of the team that analysed DNA samples from Yeates ' body , said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak , they were not of sufficient quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as DNA SenCE , which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration : We could n't say whether the DNA was from saliva , or semen , or even touch . But we could say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion . # Legal proceedings and perpetrator # # Murder charge and plea # After questioning during 96 hours of detention , Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with the murder of Joanna Yeates . He made a brief appearance at Bristol 's Magistrates ' Court on 24 January and was remanded in custody . Tabak , legally represented by Paul Cook , declined to request bail during a hearing the following day . Tabak was moved from Bristol Prison because of fears for his safety , and was placed under suicide watch at Long Lartin Prison near Evesham . Tabak 's family and friends in the Netherlands started to fundraise for his court defence . Tabak initially maintained he was not responsible for Joanna Yeates ' death , claiming that DNA evidence linking him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 8 February , he told Peter Brotherton , a prison chaplain , that he had killed her and intended to plead guilty . On 5 May 2011 , Vincent Tabak pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Yeates , but denied murdering her . His plea of guilty to manslaughter was rejected by the Crown Prosecution Service . On 20 September , Tabak appeared in person at a pre-trial hearing at Bristol Crown Court . Appearances at previous hearings had been made via videolink from prison . # Vincent Tabak # Vincent Tabak ( born 10 February 1978 ) was a Dutch engineer who had lived and worked in the United Kingdom since 2007 . The son of Gerald and Sonja Tabak , and the youngest of five siblings , he was raised in Uden , 21 miles ( 34 km ) north of Eindhoven . Tabak 's childhood next-door neighbour , John Massoeurs , described him after the trial as an intelligent introverted loner . Tabak studied at Eindhoven University of Technology beginning in 1996 , graduating with an MSc in architecture , building and planning in 2003 , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how people use space in office buildings and public areas . The paper was published in 2008 . Leaving university in 2007 , he moved to the United Kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of Buro Happold , an engineering consultancy firm in Bath , and settled in a flat in the town . He worked as a people flow analyst , a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools , airports and sports stadiums . While living in Bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through ' ' The Guardian ' ' s online dating website ' ' Soulmates ' ' . She was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend ; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis : I am very happy she entered my life . The couple moved to a flat in Canynge Road , Bristol , in June 2009 . Though Joanna Yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in Canynge Road in the autumn of 2010 , she and Tabak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months leading up to Yeates ' death , Tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States , and contacted several prostitutes by phone . He also viewed violent internet pornography that depicted women being controlled by men , showing images of them being bound and gagged , held by the neck and choked . During the murder investigation , police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates . In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts . When Yeates was discovered , she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top . At Tabak 's trial , prosecuting barrister Nigel Lickley QC , argued that the evidence of Tabak 's activities should be provided to the jury : It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life . Details of Tabak 's viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution 's case since the judge believed it did not prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was disclosed that images of child pornography had been found on Tabak 's laptop . In December 2013 , the Crown Prosecution Service announced that he would be prosecuted for possessing the material . # Trial # The trial of Vincent Tabak started on 4 October 2011 at the Crown Court at Bristol before Mr Justice Field and a jury . His counsel in the trial was William Clegg QC and the prosecutor was Nigel Lickley QC . Tabak pleaded guilty to manslaughter , but denied murder . The prosecution case was that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat within minutes of her arrival home on 17 December 2010 , using sufficient force to kill her . The prosecutors stated that Tabak around taller than Yeates had used his height and build to overpower her , pinning her to the floor by the wrists , and that she had suffered 43 separate injuries to her head , neck , torso and arms during the struggle . The injuries included cuts , bruises , and a fractured nose . Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak 's initial attack on Yeates . Evidence was presented that Tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body . The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates ' body had provided a match with Tabak . Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried , while fibres suggested contact with Tabak 's coat and car . Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered . The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Christopher Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation , and that in the days following Yeates ' death , he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area . In his defence , Tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated , and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He claimed that Yeates had made a flirty comment and invited him to drink with her . He said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her . He denied suggestions of a struggle , claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force , and .. for about 20 seconds . He told the court that after dumping the body he was .. in a state of panic . The jury was sent out to deliberate on 26 October , and returned with a verdict two days later . On 28 October 2011 , Tabak was found guilty of Joanna Yeates ' murder by a 10 to 2 majority verdict . He was jailed for life , with a minimum term of 20 years . Passing sentence , Mr Justice Field referred to a sexual element to the killing . # Media controversy # The manner in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the British media led to one television broadcaster being temporarily banned from attending press conferences , and the instigation of legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Attorney General . Following a television news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised the handling of the investigation , ITN reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case . The item , presented by journalist Geraint Vincent , claimed police had made little progress with their investigation , and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods . A former murder squad detective told the report that certain routine inquiries such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out . ITN accused the police of attempting .. to censor what information we can broadcast .. while the constabulary filed a complaint with the Office of Communications , calling the broadcast .. unfair , nave and irresponsible reporting . The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN , but said that they would .. not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future . Legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage . The contempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writing in London 's ' ' Evening Standard ' ' on 5 January 2011 , media commentator Roy Greenslade expressed concern over a number of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates ' landlord , Christopher Jefferies , following his arrest , describing the coverage as .. character assassination on a large scale . He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published , including a headline in ' ' The Sun ' ' describing Jefferies a former teacher at Clifton College as weird , posh , lewd and creepy ; a story from the ' ' Daily Express ' ' quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as .. a sort of Nutty Professor who made them feel creeped out by his strange behaviour ; and an article from the ' ' Daily Telegraph ' ' , which reported Jefferies .. has been described by pupils at Clifton College .. as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films . Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April ' ' The Sun ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Daily Express ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mail ' ' and the ' ' Daily Record ' ' seeking damages for libel . He was represented by Louis Charalambous of the law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton , who in 2008 had successfully acted for Robert Murat after he became a suspect during the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and had faced similar media scrutiny . On 29 July Jefferies accepted substantial damages for defamation from ' ' The Sun ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' , the ' ' Sunday Mirror ' ' , the ' ' Daily Record ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mail ' ' , the ' ' Daily Express ' ' , the ' ' Daily Star ' ' and ' ' The Scotsman ' ' in connection with their coverage of his arrest . In an interview following Tabak 's conviction , Jefferies commented : It has taken up a whole year virtually of my life , that period of time has meant that everything else that I would normally be doing has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the law on legal aid , which he said would prevent people with limited means from taking action against newspapers . Dominic Grieve , the Attorney General for England and Wales , stated on 31 December 2010 that he was considering action under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to enforce the obligation of the media not to prejudice a possible future trial . Criminology professor David Wilson commented on the resonance of the murder case with the national news media : The British public loves a whodunnit .. It 's a particularly British thing . We were the first nation to use murder stories to sell newspapers and that culture is more ingrained here than elsewhere . Wilson called Yeates , a white female professional , an ideal victim for the media . On 1 January , Yeates ' boyfriend Greg Reardon commented on the media coverage surrounding the arrest of Christopher Jefferies : Jo 's life was cut short tragically but the finger-pointing and character assassination by social and news media of as yet innocent men has been shameful . On 12 May 2011 , the Administrative Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committal for contempt of court against ' ' The Sun ' ' and the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' for the way they had reported the arrest of Jefferies . On 29 July , the court ( Lord Judge CJ , Thomas LJ &amp; Owen J ) ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court , and fined the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' 50,000 and ' ' The Sun ' ' 18,000 . The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , Lord Judge , stated that .. in our judgment , as a matter of principle , the vilification of a suspect under arrest is a potential impediment to the course of justice . The publishers of ' ' The Sun ' ' and the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' subsequently appealed their fines , but the ' ' Mirror ' ' case was rejected by the Supreme Court of England and Wales on 9 March 2012 , whilst ' ' The Sun ' ' withdrew its appeal . # Ramifications # The Yeates case was mentioned during a Parliamentary debate on a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any journalist who names an uncharged suspect . The proposed legislation was introduced into the House of Commons in June 2010 , by Anna Soubry , the Conservative MP for Broxtowe , a former journalist and criminal law barrister . In a debate on 4 February 2011 Soubry told the House : What we saw in Bristol was , in effect , a feeding frenzy and vilification . Much of the coverage was not only completely irrelevant , but there was a homophobic tone to it which I found deeply offensive . The slurs on the man were out of order . However , she withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition from the Conservative-led coalition government . Jefferies gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry , established by Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the ' ' News of the World ' ' phone hacking affair . Jefferies told the inquiry that reporters had besieged him after he was questioned by the police ; he said : It was clear that the tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my guilt . They embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue . Appearing before the same inquiry on 16 January 2012 , the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' editor , Richard Wallace , described the newspaper 's coverage of Jefferies ' arrest as a black mark on his editing record . # Aftermath and memorials # Associate vicar Dan Clark led a memorial service for Yeates at Christ Church in Clifton on 2 January 2011 . Prayers for her were also said at the church on 17 December 2011 , the first anniversary of her death , while visitors left tributes and messages of condolence for her family . Greg Reardon started a charity website in Yeates ' memory to raise funds on behalf of families of missing people . Yeates ' friends and family planted a memorial garden at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens in Romsey where she had worked as a student . Building Design Partnership and the local NHS trust announced plans to commemorate her with a memorial in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital in Southmead , Bristol . Other plans for memorials included a garden of remembrance at the BDP firm 's studio in Bristol , a published anthology of Yeates ' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire . BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary , with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family . Yeates left behind an estate valued at 47,000 , which included money set aside to purchase a home with Reardon . As she had not written a will , the sum was inherited by her parents . Following the release of her body on 31 January 2011 , Yeates ' family arranged to hold her funeral at St Mark 's of Ampfield , Hampshire , and have her interred in the churchyard . Yeates was buried on 11 February ; approximately 300 people attended the service , which was led by vicar Peter Gilks . In 2013 , ITV commissioned a drama about the arrest of Christopher Jefferies titled ' ' The Lost Honour ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watkins in the leading role , began in November .
