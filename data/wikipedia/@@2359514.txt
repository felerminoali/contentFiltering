Bah ' history is often traced through a sequence of leaders , beginning with the Bb 's May 23 , 1844 declaration in Shiraz , and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion . The religion had its background in two earlier movements in the nineteenth century , Shaykhism and Babism . Shaykhism centred on theosophical doctrines and many Shaykhis expected the return of the hidden Twelfth Imam . Many Shaykhis joined the messianic Babi movement in the 1840s where the Bb proclaimed himself to be the return of the hidden Imam . As the Babi movement spread in Iran , violence broke out between the ruling Shi'a Muslim government and the Babis , and ended when government troops massacred the Babis , and executed the Bab in 1850 . The Bab had spoken of another messianic figure , He whom God shall make manifest . One of the followers of the Bab , Bah'u'llh was imprisoned by the Iranian government after the Bab 's execution and then exiled to Iraq , and then to Constantinople and Adrianople in the Ottoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the messianic figure expected by the Bab 's writings . Bah ' s consider the Baha'i religion to start from Bah'u'llh 's statements in 1863 . At the time of Bah'u'llh 's death the tradition was mostly confined to the Persian and Ottoman empires , at which time he had followers in thirteen countries of Asia and Africa . Leadership of the religion then passed on to Abdu'l-Bah , Bah'u'llh 's son , who was appointed by Bah'u'llh , and was accepted by almost all Bah ' s . Under the leadership of Abdu'l-Bah , the religion gained a footing in Europe and America , and was consolidated in Iran , where it still suffers intense persecution . After the death of Abdu'l-Bah in 1921 , the leadership of the Bah ' community was passed on to his grandson , Shoghi Effendi , who was appointed in Abdu'l-Bah 's will . The document appointed Shoghi Effendi as the first ' ' Guardian ' ' , and called for the election of the Universal House of Justice once the Bah ' Faith had spread sufficiently for such elections to be meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion there was a great increase in the number of Baha'is , and he presided over the election of many National Spiritual Assemblies . Shoghi Effendi died in 1957 , and because he was childless he had found it impossible to appoint another Guardian after himself to succeed him . In 1963 the Universal House of Justice was elected . Since 1963 the Universal House of Justice has been elected every five years and remains the successor and leading institution of the religion . See Bah ' Faith by country for further information per country . # Shaykhi movement # In Islam , the Mahdi is a messianic figure who is believed to be a descendant of Muhammad who will return near the end of time to restore the world and the religion of God . While both Sunni and Shi'a groups believe in the Mahdi , the largest Shi'a group , the Twelvers , believe that the Mahdi is the Twelfth Imam , Muhammad al-Mahdi , who is believed to have gone into occultation since 874 CE . In the Twelver view the Twelfth Imam first went into a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Hidden Imam still communicated with the community through four official intermediaries . The ' ' Greater Occultation ' ' is then defined from the time when the Hidden Imam ceased to communicate regularly until the time when he returns to restore the world . # Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahs ' # The Shaykhi movement was a school of theology within Twelver Shi'a Islam that was started through the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahs ' . Shaykh Ahmad 's teachings included that the Imams were spiritual beings and thus , in contrast to the widespread Shi'a belief , that the Imams existed within spiritual bodies , and not material bodies . He also taught that there must always exist the Perfect Shi'a who serves as an intermediary between the Imams and the believers , and is the one who can visualize the consciousness of the Hidden Imam . In 1822 he left Iran and went to Iraq due to the controversy that his teachings had brought . There he also found himself at the centre of debate , thus deciding to move to Mecca , he died in 1826 on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shaykh Ahmad , he appointed Siyyid Kzim of Rasht to lead the Shaykh movement , which he did until his death in 1843 . Siyyid Kzim formulated many of the thoughts that were ambiguously expressed by Shaykh Ahmad including the doctrine of salvation history and the cycles of revelation . His teaching brought a sense of millenarian hope among the Shaykhis that the Hidden Imam may return . Siyyid Kazim did not leave a successor , but before his death in December , 1843 , he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Mahdi , who according to his prophecies would soon appear . # Bb # Siyyid Al-Muhammad , who later took on the title the Bb , was born on October 20 , 1819 , in Shiraz to a merchant of the city ; his father died while he was quite young and the boy was raised by his maternal uncle j Mrz Siyyid Al , who was also a merchant . In May 1844 the Bb proclaimed to Mulla Husayn , one of the Shaykhis , to be the one whose coming was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divine knowledge . Within five months , seventeen other disciples of Siyyid Kim had recognized the Bb as a Manifestation of God . These eighteen disciples were later to be known as the Letters of the Living and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq . The Bb initially attracted most of the followers of the Shaykh movement , but soon his teachings went far beyond those roots and attracted prominent followers across Iran . His followers were known as Bbs . After some time , preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy , prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Bb 's arrest . After being house arrest in Shiraz from June 1845 to September 1846 , the Bb spent several months in Isfahan debating clergy , many who became sympathetic . He was then ordered by the Shah to Tehran in January 1847 ; after spending several months in a camp outside Tehran , the Prime Minister sent the Bb to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country , where he was confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the province of Azarbaijan close to the Turkish border . During his incarceration there , the Bb began his most important work , the Persian Bayn , which he never finished . He was then transferred to the fortress of Chihrq in April 1848 . In that place as well , the Bb 's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him . Hence the Prime Minister ordered the Bb back to Tabriz where the government called on religious authorities to put the Bb on trial for blasphemy and apostasy . Bbism was also spreading across the country , and the Islamic government saw it as a threat to state religion and several military confrontations took place between government and Bb forces . Communities of Bbs established themselves in Iran and Irq , and in 1850 reached several cities of Azarbaijan . In mid-1850 a new prime-minister , Amir Kabir , In 1909 , the remains were then interred in a special tomb , erected for this purpose by Abdu'l-Bah , on Mount Carmel in the Bah ' Holy Land in Haifa and remains an important place of pilgrimage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station of revelation , he also claimed no finality for his revelation . A constant theme in his works , especially the Persian Bayan was that of the great Promised One , the next embodiment of the Primal Will , whom the Bb termed He whom God shall make manifest , promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth . In the books written by the Bb he constantly entreats his believers to follow He whom God shall make manifest when he arrives . Before his death , the Bb had been in correspondence with two brothers , Bah'u'llh and Subh-i-Azal who , after the death of many prominent disciples , emerged as the mostly likely leaders . In a letter sent to Subh-i-Azal , then aged around nineteen , the Bb appears to have indicated a high station or leadership position . The letter also orders Subh-i-Azal to obey the Promised One when he appears ; in practise , Subh-i-Azal , however , seems to have had little widespread legitimacy and authority . Bah'u'llh in the meantime , while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his messianic secret from most and supported Subh-i-Azal in the interest of unity . In 1863 in Baghdad , he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of Bbs as He whom God shall make manifest and his followers began calling themselves Bah ' s. # Bah'u'llh # Bah'u'llh was born on November 12 , 1817 , in Tehran . Bah'u'llh 's father was entitled Mrz Buzurg while he served as vizier to Imm-Virdi Mrz , the twelfth son of Fath Ali Shah Qajar . Mrz Buzurg was later appointed governor of Burujird and Lorestan , a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when Muhammad Shah came to power . After his father died , Bah'u'llh was asked to take a government post by the new vizier Haji Mirza Aqasi , but he declined the position . At the age of 28 , Bah'u'llh received a messenger , Mull Husayn , telling him of the Bb , whose message he accepted , becoming a Bb . Bah'u'llh began to spread the new cause , especially in his native province of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believers . The accompanying government suppression of the Bb 's religion resulted in Bah'u'llh 's being imprisoned twice and enduring bastinado torture once Bah'u'llh also attended the Conference of Badasht , where 81 prominent Babis met for 22 days ; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Babis who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Bb 's message began a new dispenation , Bah'u'llh took the pro-change side , which eventually won out . In 1852 , two years after the execution of the Bb , the Bbs was polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against the Shah , Nasser-al-Din Shah while the other , under the leadership of Bahaullah , looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Bab cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living . The militant group of Babis was between thirty and seventy persons , only a small number of the total Babi population of perhaps 100,000 . Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a Husayn Jan , an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met briefly with a couple of the radical Babi leaders and learned of an assassination plan . He condemned the plan , but was soon asked to leave Tehran by the authorities . on August 15 , 1852 about 3 Babis attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed . Notwithstanding the assassins ' claim that they were working alone , the entire Bb community was blamed , and a slaughter of several thousand Bbs followed . Amidst the general violence some Bbs were imprisoned in the Syh-Chl ( Black Pit ) , an underground dungeon of Tehran . According to Bah'u'llh , perhaps the lone survivor , it was during his imprisonment in the Syh-Chl that he had several mystical experiences , and that he received a vision of a Maiden from God , through whom he received his mission as a Messenger of God and as the One whose coming the Bb had prophesied . The government later found Bah'u'llh innocent of complicity in the assassination plot , and he was released from the Syh-Chl , but the government exiled him from Iran . Bah'u'llh chose to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1853 . A small number of Babis , including his half-brother Subh-i-Azal , followed Bah'u'llh to Baghdad . An increasing number of Bbs considered Baghdad the new centre for leadership of the Bb religion , and a flow of pilgrims started coming there from Persia . In Baghdad people began to look to Subh-i-Azal for leadership less and less due to his policy of remaining hidden , and instead saw Bah'u'llh as their leader . Subh-i-Azal started to try to discredit Bah'u'llh and further divided the community . The actions of Subh-i-Azal drove many people away from the religion and allowed its enemies to continue their persecution . On April 10 , 1854 Bah'u'llh left Baghdad in order to distance himself from Subh-i-Azal and as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Babi community ; he left with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan , north-east of Baghdad , near the city Sulaymaniyah . For two years Bah'u'llh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan living the life of a Sufi dervish . At one point someone noticed his remarkable penmanship , which brought the curiosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in Kurdistan he wrote many notable books including the Four Valleys . In Baghdad , given the lack of firm and public leadership by Subh-i-Azal , the Babi community had fallen into disarray . Some Babis , including Bah'u'llh 's family , thus searched for Bah'u'llh , and pleaded with him to come back to Baghdad , which he did in 1856 . Bah'u'llh remained in Baghdd for seven more years . During this time , while keeping his perceived station as the Manifestation of God hidden , he taught the Bb 's teachings . He published many books and verses including the Book of Certitude and the Hidden Words . Bah'u'llh 's gatherings attracted many notables , both locals and Iranian pilgrims , giving him greater influence in Baghdad and in Iran . His rising influence in the city , and the revival of the Persian Bb community gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government . They were eventually successful in having the Ottoman government call Bah'u'llh from Baghdad to Constantinople . Before he left Baghdad on the way to Constantinople , Bah'u'llh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad starting on April 22 , 1863 . During his stay in the garden a large number of friends came to see him before he left . It was during his time in the Garden of Ridvn that Bah'u'llh declared to his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God . Today Bah ' s celebrate the twelve days that Bah'u'llh was in the Garden of Ridvn as the festival of Ridvn . After travelling for four-month over land , Bah'u'llh arrived in the capital of the Ottoman Empire , Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) . Although not a formal prisoner yet , the forced exile from Baghdad was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually the penal colony of Akk , Palestine ( now Acre , Israel ) . Bah'u'llh and his family , along with a small group of Bbs , stayed in Constantinople for only four months . Due to his refusal to build alliances with the Ottoman politicians , Bah'u'llh had no means of resisting pressure from the Iranian ambassador to exile him further away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edirne ) , which was a site for the exile of political prisoners . During the month of December 1863 , Bah'u'llh and his family embarked on a twelve-day journey to Adrianople . Bah'u'llh stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years . In Adrianople Bah'u'llh made his claim to be Him whom God shall make manifest more public through letters and tablets . Bah'u'llh 's assertion as an independent Manifestation of God made Subh-i-Azal 's leadership position irrelevant ; Subh-i-Azal , upon hearing Bah'u'llh 's words in a tablet read to him , challenging him to accept Bah'u'llh 's revelation , refused and challenged Bah'u'llh to a test of divine will at a local mosque , but he lost face when he did not appear . This caused a break within the Bb community , and the followers of Bah'u'llh became known as Bah ' s , while the followers of Subh-i-Azal became known as Azalis . Starting in 1866 , while in Adrianople , Bah'u'llh started writing a series of letters to world rulers , proclaiming his station as the promised one of all religions . His letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to settle disputes , and endeavour towards the betterment of the world and its peoples . Some of these leaders written to in the coming years include Pope Pius IX , Napoleon III of France , Czar Alexander II of Russia , Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland , Nsirid-Dn Shh of the Persian Empire and the rulers of America . The disagreements between the Bah ' s and the Azals allowed the Ottoman and Persian authorities to exile Bah'u'llh once again . Bah'u'llh and his family left Adrianople on August 12 , 1868 and after a journey by land and sea arrived in Acre on August 31 . The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions on , and held very trying times for , Bah'u'llh . Mirz Mihd , Bah'u'llh 's son , was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation . After some time , the people and officials began to trust and respect Bah'u'llh , and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually , after Sultan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and visit nearby places . From 1877 until 1879 Bah'u'llh lived in the house of Mazra'ih . The final years of Bah'u'llh 's life were spent in the Mansion of Bahj , just outside Acre , even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire . During his years in Acre and Bahj , Bah'u'llh produced many volumes of work including the Kitb-i-Aqdas . On May 9 , 1892 Bah'u'llh contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days , abated , and then finally took his life on May 29 , 1892 . He was buried in a Shrine located next to the Mansion of Bahj . During his lifetime , communities of Bah ' s were established in Armenia , Burma , Egypt , Georgia , India , Lebanon , ( what is now ) Pakistan , ( what was then ) Palestine , Sudan , Syria , Turkey , and Turkmenistan . # Abdu'l-Bah # Bah'u'llh was succeeded by his eldest son , Abdu'l-Bah . Designated as the Center of the Covenant and Head of the Faith , Bah'u'llh designated him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings . Abdu'l-Bah had shared his father 's long exile and imprisonment . This imprisonment continued until Abdu'l-Bah 's own release as a result of the Young Turk revolution in 1908 . The remains of the Bb were buried on March 21 , 1909 in a six-room mausoleum made of local stone . Following his release he led a life of travelling and speaking especially 19101913 , and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals , expounding the principles of the Bah ' Faith . Abdu'l-Bah died in Haifa on November 28 , 1921 and is now buried in one of the front rooms in the Shrine of the Bb . During his lifetime communities of Bah ' s formed in Australia , Austria , Brazil , Canada , China , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Holland , Hungary , Italy , Japan , Jordan , Russia , South Africa , Switzerland , Tunisia , and the United States of America . # Tomb of the Bb # # Journeys to the West # # Will and Testament # -- # Shoghi Effendi # Abdu'l-Bah 's Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order .
