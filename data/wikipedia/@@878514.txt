subdivisiontype1 = Province Shanballymore ( : Old Town ) is a small village and civil district in north County Cork , Ireland . It neighbours the towns of Doneraile , Kildorrery and Castletownroche , and is off the main route from Mallow to Mitchelstown . The village church is Catholic Church of Christ the King . Shanballymore is also the name of winner of the Irish Derby Stakes in 1911 ( however the horse was not named after this town in County Cork ) . Its population is 553 ( 2006 Census ) . # History # Shanballymore also historically referred to as Templeruan Sonnachgowan ( Old Town ) is situated on the North bank of the Awbeg River Spenser 's ' Mulla Fair ' astride the road from Mallow to Mitchelstown . It is also traversed by the ' Bianconi Road ' . This is the old road which crosses Wallstown Hill over the river and Clogher Hill , the cobbled surface of which can still be seen in a few places .

The earliest appears in the Crichad on Chaoille ( c. 1100 ) and the Papal Taxation of Pope Nicholas , 1291 ; Sonnach Gobunn , the second name , Templeroan makes its appearance as an alternative name about 1400 and remains as the name of the Civil ( legal ) or Church of Ireland parish . This latter name is important , as census figures and other official information for the parish will be found under this title . The youngest name is Shanballymore , the name of the Roman Catholic parish . That it has a history worth telling is evident from the fact that , within its 3,866 acres , it contained four tower houses or castles , via Balllinamona , Sonnach ( or Shannagh ) , Castleruan and Dannanstown , and three churches , Kilelly , kilclagmusey &amp; Templeroan , . Each will be discussed in its place . There is also a reference to a Shanballymore Castle , but that would appear to be in error for Castleruahn . The vicinity of Shanballymore was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishes , as shown in the ' Crichid an Chaoilli ' , a description of the area no known as the Barony of Fermoy . The text appears in ' The Book of Lismore ( more correctly the book of Mac carthaigh Riabhach , which was found in the early eighteen-hundreds , hidden in the walls of Lismore Castle . the Crichad portion of the text is almost unique , offering a description of Irish land holding c. 1100 , the limits of the estates and the major families of the area , it was edited and translated on three occasions , first in Patrick , Cardinals Moran 's editing of Mervyn Archdall 's Monasticon Hibernicus 1873 second by JG O'Keeffe in the scholarly periodical ' Eriu ' in 1928 and third Patrick Power 's publication of 1932 . This latter is most useful to the local historian , since it has an Introduction which places the work in its context , a transcript and photographic reproduction of the text - for the scholar in medieval Irish a translation and extensive notes on places and place names . Power was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of disciplines . He was professor of archaeology in UCC the author of a History of the Diocese of Waterford , a major work on the place names of the diocese and translated the lives of ss Declan &amp; Mochuda . The parish is represented in the crichad by the ' bailies ' of Sonnach Gobann and cluain Lochluinn and the main family were the Hi Gobunn . This is possibly the family who gave their to Ballygowan in Killavullen Parish . Sonnach remains in the townland of Shannagh . The Parish was valued in the papal Taxation of Pope Nicholas in 1291 at 5 marks ( 2 old pounds 13 shillings and 4 pence ) and taxed at a tithe or tenth . It is not mentioned in the pipe Roll of Cloyne ( c. 1370 ) . it appears from other documents of the period and later , to have been united with Wallstown &amp; Ballygrigan parishes rather than Doneraile . In 1821 the population of the Parish was 1,413 people , 668 males and 745 females divided into 253 families and living in 236 houses . 413 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 564 males and 590 females , in these years the village population rose from 199 in 1821 , to 415 in 80 houses in 1831 , and in 1841 , some 471 people in 89 houses ( mostly thatched ) and 392 in 1851 . A Patent exists for a Fair but it is not now held . In 1821 there were 164 boys and 54 girls in school in the parish . In 1826 there were 2 schools in Shanballymore and Ballyhourode , where Matthew Reardon taught 32 boys and 18 girls , all Roman Catholics in a wretched hovel which beggars description and the other in Shanballymore where James Riall was Master to either 122 or 100 pupils in a sonte and mud thatched house . The primary valuation of 1851 listed Patrick O'Keefe as the National Teacher in Shanballymore . Ballinamona ( The town of the bog ) Here is a remains of a Nagle Castle - one of the many in Shanballymore , Annikisha and Killavullen .

One part of the castle no longer to be seen is a ' sheela-na-gig ' which was found built into the wall and later destroyed . Sheelas were usually relief 's carved in stone and set into castle and Church walls possible to ward off evil . They take the form of rather grotesque Females and appear to have originated as church ornaments . Legend has it that Garret Nagle of Ballinamona was in London cutting a figure of the coronation of King George IV and his workmen found the sheela in the castle . Being considerably upset by the lewd figure , they broke it , They also broke the ' luck ' as shortly after Nagle had to sell the castle and lands to cover debts . .
