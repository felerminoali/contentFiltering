I had many painting instructors , but Cameron Booth knew , and taught me , Abstract Expressionist ideas . It was the way I came into painting . In 2005 , Molly Priesmeyer said in City Pages : # During the ' 50s , Wiener was one of the few exhibiting woman artists in Minnesota . ( Four of the 23 artists in Abstract Painting : Selected Works are female . ) There was a lot of chauvinism , she says . I remember one time someone said , ' There are few women who ever make it . ' And my friend said to him , ' Well ! You know , there are few men who ever make it , too !
