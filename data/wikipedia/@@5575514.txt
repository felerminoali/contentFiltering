The Arca di San Domenico ( Ark of Saint Dominic ) is a monument containing the remains of Saint Dominic . It is located in Dominics Chapel in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna , Italy . # History # The elaboration of this artistic masterpiece was performed in separate stages by the best sculptors of their time and took almost 500 years to finish . Saint Dominic died in the convent of the church of San Nicol delle Vigne on 6 August 1221 . He was buried behind the altar . The church of San Nicol was expanded into the Basilica of San Domenico between 1228 and 1240 . The remains of the saint were moved in 1233 from its place behind the altar into a simple marble sarcophagus , situated on the floor in the right aisle of the church for the faithful . Since most of the pilgrims , who came in great numbers to see the grave , were not able to see this shrine , hidden by so many people standing in front of it , the need was felt for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new tomb for their founder to Nicola Pisano , the famous sculptor of the pulpit of the Pisa Baptistery . He was certainly responsible for the design of the new sarcophagus , but in 1265 he was already at work on another assignment , the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral . The front side was done in his workshop , partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto . The rectangular sarcophagus was originally borne on caryatid figures . When the Ark was later redesigned , these supports were dispersed and are now tentatively identified in several museums : the archangels Michael and Gabriel ( in the Victoria and Albert Museum , London ) , the statue Faith ( Louvre , Paris ) , a group of three deacons ( in the Bargello , Florence ) and a similar group in the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston . The sarcophagus was relocated in the middle of the church in 1411 . Between 1469 and 1473 a crowning was added on the flat top of the sarcophagus by Niccol dell'Arca and several other masters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who added the statuettes of San Petronio ( the patron saint of Bologna ) , a candlestic-holding angel and San Procolo ( closely recalling the statue of David , made ten years later ) . In 1532 , a step was added between the sarcophagus and the altar slab by Alfonso Lombardi . The Saint Dominics chapel was built by the Bolognese architect Floriano Ambrosini from 1597 , replacing the small gothic chapel from 1413 . The Dominicans wanted a chapel for their founder to match the splendour of the other existing chapels . The fresco on the cupola of the apse ' ' St. Dominics Glory ' ' , a masterpiece by Guido Reni , painted between 1613 and 1615 , matches the artistic value of the underlying Ark of St. Dominic . Finally the whole tomb was put on a marble altar in the 18th century . In a little chapel , on the back of the tomb , is the golden reliquary with the ' ' Head of St. Dominic ' ' , a masterpiece by Jacopo Roseto da Bologna ( 1383 ) . # The sarcophagus # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the shrine . It contains the remains of Saint Dominic in a cypress coffin , with the exception of his head ( which is preserved in the reliquary at the back of the monument ) . Nicola Pisano , already famous for his pulpit in the Pisa Baptistery , was asked in 1264 to construct this sarcophagus . He was certainly responsible for the design , but left the brunt of the work to his workshop , since in 1265 he was already at work on a new commission ( the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral ) . The front side was done in his workshop , partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto. and another famous sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio . The Dominican brother fra Guglielmo da Pisa ( who also designed in 1270 a pulpit in San Giovanni Fuorcivitas in Pistoia ) made a small contribution . According to ' ' Gnudi ' ' ( see ref. ) an anonymous Fifth Master was also involved . A collaboration of several sculptors on a such a large commission was normal practice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Dominic in a series of six carved panels . The compositions are neatly filled with figures in organized rows , giving a single approach to space . The sarcophagus is flanked on each corner by statues in high-relief of the Four Doctors of the Church . The scenes are arranged in following sequence from left to right and counterclockwise : *On the left corner stands ' ' Paul the Apostle ' ' . * ' ' St. Dominic resurrects the young Napoleone Orsini , after a fatal fall from his horse ' ' . The expressive face of Saint Dominic , so different from the blander faces in this front panel , is attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio. *In the middle : a high-relief of ' ' A Virgin and Child ' ' . * ' ' The Miracle of the Book rejected by Fire ' ' , acting out a story of Dominics preaching in Fanjeaux , southern France , against the Albigensian heresy . * on the right corner ' ' St. Dominic with the Book and the Scourge ' ' . * ' ' The Angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , representing one of the first miracles of the saint . * The back of the tomb gives two scenes ( each with three episodes ) , divided by a statue of ' ' Christ the Redeemer ' ' . ** On the left a scene of the life of Blessed Reginald of Orlans , founder of the monastery in Bologna ; ' ' the Blessed promises St Dominic to enter the Order ' ' ; ' ' the Blessed falls ill ' ' ; ' ' the Virgin heals him and gives him the habit of the Preaching Friars ' ' ** on the right : ' ' St. Dominic asks pope Innocent III to approve the Order ' ' ; ' ' the pope dreams of the Saint supporting the basilica of the Lateran ' ' ; ' ' the pope approves the foundation of the Order . ' ' * In the corner on the right : a high-relief of ' ' St. Augustine ' ' , author of the Dominican Rule . *The last relief gives two more episodes : ' ' The Apostles Peter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the basilica of St. Peter , and give him the staff and the Book ' ' ( symbols of the Apostolic mission ) ; ' ' the Saint sends his followers out on their mission to preach in the world . ' ' Work on the sarcophagus was finished in 1267 . This sarcophagus , originally with its caryatid supports , was taken as model for other tombs : the shrine of St Peter Martyr in the basilica of San Eustorgio in Milan , the shrine of St Luke ( 1316 ) in the basilica of San Giustina in Padua and the tomb of Beato Bertrando ( c. 1334-1350 ) in Udine. # The crowning # The ambitious addition of a crowning to the sarcophagus was commissioned in 1469 to Niccol da Bari to complete this funeral monument . Work at this elaborate spire continued till 1473 . But it is not clear why Niccol did not complete his contract , even if he did continue intermittently at it until his death.in 1494 . On top of a candelabrum , rising from the cyma , stands the impressive statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is held by two putti , symbols of the sky , and four dolphins , symbols of the sea , all covered with festoons with fruit , symbols of the earth . On the cornice at its base is in the middle a small ' ' Piet ' ' , flanked by two winged angels ( the ' ' Angel of the Annunciation ' ' and the ' ' Angel of the Passion ' ' ) , while on the four corners stand the four Evangelists in oriental robes . The lower part of the cyma is surrounded by several free-standing figures , the Patron Saints of Bologna : Saint Francis of Assisi , San Petronio ( began by Niccol but finished by young Michelangelo in 1494 ) , Saint Dominic and Saint Florian . On the back stand the statues St Anne , St John the Baptist ( sculpted by Girolamo Cortellini in 1539 ) , San Vitale and San Procolo ( Michelangelo , 1494 the resemblance and the posture of this statue shows that he had already his David in mind at that time ) . Niccol also added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side of the altar slab , below the sarcophagus , while the one on the right side with its youthful strength is by Michelangelo . Michelangelo was paid thirty ducats by his patron Francesco Aldovrandi . Because of the admiration he received for this splendid masterpiece , he was renamed Niccol dell'Arca . Art critics perceive in this masterpiece a blend of influences : Burgundian , Florentine and non-Tuscan ( such as details in clothing ) . The way these statuettes express their emotions and the patterns in their dresses and hair evoke the style of Jacopo della Quercia # The step # The step , between the sarcophagus and the altar slab , was the third addition to the monument . It was sculpted in 1532 by Alfonso Lombardi ( 14971547 ) . Again it depicts a number of episodes form the life of Saint Dominic . * front : ( left ) ' ' St Dominics birth ' ' ; the ' ' young Dominic sleeping on the floor as a penance ' ' ; ' ' Saint Dominic shows his charity by selling his valuable hand-glossed parchments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying in Palencia ) * front ( middle part ) ' ' The Adoration of the Magi ' ' ( with the inscription : ' ' Alphonsus de Lombardis Ferraniensis F(ecit) ' ' ) * front ( right ) ' ' The Saint is taken to Heaven on a ladder supported by Christ and the Virgin ' ' . # The altar # The marble altar was the last addition to the Arca .
