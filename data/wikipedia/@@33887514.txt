Cathy Ames is a fictional character and the main antagonist in John Steinbeck 's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ' ' East of Eden ' ' . She is the wife of main protagonist Adam Trask , and the mother of his twin sons , Caleb and Aron . Beneath her charming , attractive facade , she is an evil woman who manipulates and destroys people for her own amusement and profit . Steinbeck characterizes her as a psychic monster with a malformed soul . # Concept and creation # In 1951 , Steinbeck wrote a series of letters , known as ' ' The Journal of a Novel : The East of Eden Letters ' ' , to his editor Pascal Covici during the process of writing ' ' East of Eden ' ' . On March 26 , Steinbeck first mentions Cathy to Covici : This is a woman and you must know her ; know her completely because she is a tremendously powerful force in the book . The majority of these letters demonstrate that Steinbeck was most fascinated with Cathys character , mentioning once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Physical description # Steinbeck depicts Cathy as small-breasted , delicate , blonde and beautiful , with oil-soaked skin that gives her a pearly-light and a sense of allurement . Her beauty fools most of the people she encounters , but a few characters detect her true nature by looking into her eyes , which Steinbeck describes as cold and emotionless ; Samuel Hamilton , a supporting character in the novel , takes note that the eyes of Cathy had no message , no communicationthey were not human eyes . As the novel progresses , Cathy becomes increasingly less attractive . She develops crippling arthritis in her hands , and by the end of the novel she is described as a sick ghost . # Appearances in the novel ' ' East of Eden ' ' # # Part 1 # Throughout Cathys childhood , she pointedly causes harm to anyone who holds a relationship with her .

Soon afterward , she robs the safe and burns down her family home while her parents are trapped inside , killing them . She then runs away from her hometown and entrances a whoremaster by the name of Mr. Edwards . The two become lovers for a time , until Mr. Edwards begins to suspect she is being dishonest with him , particularly after she gets drunk and tells him she despises him .

Charles sees through her and tries to warn his lovestruck brother , who refuses to listen . Part one ends with Cathy drugging Adam into a deep sleep and then having sex with Charles . # Part 2 # After moving to California with Adam , Cathy becomes pregnant ( the novel is ambiguous as to whether by Charles or Adam ) and in turn attempts a primitive abortion on herself with a knitting needle . She fails , however , and decides to carry on with the pregnancy . Though she warns Adam that she plans to leave as soon as she is able , he brushes this off as homesickness . She leaves her family a few weeks after giving birth to twin sons , and shoots Adam in the shoulder when he tries to stop her .

Kate begins secretly poisoning Faye , and finally kills her by overdosing her on pain medication . She then assumes full ownership of the whorehouse , which she turns into a den of sexual sadism . # Part 3 # The plot steers away from Kates life for some years , until her husband , Adam , visits her at the whorehouse . She reveals her motives for the first time , admitting that , from a young age , she took pleasure in using people : I could make them do whatever I wantedwhen I was half-grown I made a man kill himself . She then shows Adam pictures of multiple public figures , including a Congressman and a priest , who visit the whorehouse , and denounces the entire human race as a pack of hypocrites ; she tells Adam that shed rather be a dog than a human .

Adam finally sees Kate for what she is and pities her , telling her : And the men who come to you here with their ugliness , the men in the pictures -- you do nt believe those men could have goodness or beauty in them . You see only one side , and you think -- more than that , youre sure -- thats all there is. # Part 4 # Years later , her son Cal visits her . Cals goodness makes Kate uncomfortable , especially when he states his love for his father , Adam : a curious spasm shook Kate -- an aching twist tore in her chest .

Literary critic Sarah Aguiar notes that this incident causes Kate to feel remorse for the first time . She signs over all her possessions to Aron , not Cal . She then commits suicide by taking a lethal dose of morphine . # Archetypes # # The Devil # One of the main characteristics of ' ' East of Eden ' ' is the prevalent allegory with the Bible and the battle between good and evil . In a letter to family friend Allen Ludden , Steinbeck states that Kate is a total representative of Satan . As noted by John Timmerman , Steinbeck demonstrates the devil allegory through repeated snake-like imagery used to describe Cathy . In one instance in the novel , Samuel Hamilton observes that when Cathy swallowed , her tongue flicked around her lipsthe eyes were flat and the mouth with its small up-curve at the corners was carven , giving a serpentine air to Cathys demeanor. # Pandora # Cathy also takes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Zeus gave Pandora a box and commanded her not to open it . She ultimately disobeys and when she opens the box , she sets loose evil into the world . In an academic article from the ' ' The Explicator ' ' , Rebecca Barnes analyzes that Cathy is like Pandora in that her broken box brings disaster wherever she goes . In the novel Cathy destroys every life she touches : she murders her parents , drives her Latin teacher to commit suicide , shoots her husband , poisons her benefactress , and sadistically abuses ( and later blackmails ) countless men as a prostitute . # Psychoanalysis # In Stephen Georges article The Emotional Content of Cruelty , he writes that Cathy embodies hatred and fear , which he argues are the main motivators behind human cruelty . He writes that Cathy fears losing control in any way ; for example , she refuses to drink because alcohol brings out her true nature . Her method of controlling her environment comes in the form of paranoia , which is manifested by her desire to manipulate men sexually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she feels superior to those she manipulates . In her essay No Sanctuary , Sarah Aguiar writes that Cathy 's actions are due to a perversion of human virtues such as compassion and love . Aguiar explains this deficiency is due to Cathy 's child-like egocentricitythe desperate needto protect herself at all costs . Steinbeck further comments in his ' ' East of Eden ' ' letters that Cathy is in part evil because her life is one of revenge on other people because of a vague feeling of her own lack. # Film adaptations # Actress Jo Van Fleet won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Cathy Ames in the 1955 film adaptation of ' ' East of Eden ' ' . In 1982 , Jane Seymour received a Best Actress Golden Globe award for her portrayal of Cathy Ames in the ABC mini-series adaptation of ' ' East of Eden ' ' .
