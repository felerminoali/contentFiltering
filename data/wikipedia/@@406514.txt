GameLine was a dialup game distribution service for the Atari 2600 , developed and operated by Control Video Corporation ( CVC ) . Subscribers could install the proprietary modem and storage cartridge in their home game console , accessing the GameLine service to download games over a telephone line . GameLine is notable for its exclusive selection of games , and for its pioneering business model which eventually gave rise to America Online . In the early 1980s , a cable pioneer named William von Meister was looking for a way to use his innovative modem transmission technology , which was previously acquired in ill-fated attempts of sending music to cable companies . Legal issues caused cable providers to step away from the service , leaving Von Meister with a delivery tool and no content . He then converted his variable speed adaptive modem technology to download games from central servers to individual households . This allowed users to dial a system and , for a fee , download games to their GameLine modules . The game would typically work for 5-10 plays , after which the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another download . The Master Module physically resembles an oversized silver Atari cartridge . It has a phone jack on the side that was used to link the Master Module with the CVC computers . The module is able to transmit with pulse or tone dialing , allowing the unit to be versatile in the field . The games available on the GameLine service were all from third-party gamemakers , the largest of which was Imagic ( whose catalog is now controlled by Activision ) . CVC tried , but failed to obtain licensing agreements from the largest game makers , such as Atari , Activision , Coleco , Mattel , and Parker Brothers . # Membership benefits # When a user registered with the service , they were given a PIN . This PIN was used to log into the central CVC computer and download the requested games . One of the benefits of registering was that users were given free games on their birthday . GameLine provided players an opportunity to compete in contests with selected games , where they could upload a high score . Prizes would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One such regional prize was a GameLine windbreaker . Each subscriber to GameLine also received a professionally printed magazine titled ' ' GameLiner ' ' . ' ' GameLiner ' ' consists of information about new games added to the service , questions and answers , advice on better gameplay , and a list of all currently available games on GameLine. # Discontinuation # GameLine was originally envisioned to not provide just games , but also news ( NewsLine ) , stock quotes ( StockLine ) , sports reporting and scores ( SportLine ) , electronic mail ( MailLine ) , online banking ( BankLine ) , online forums ( OpinionLine ) , and a wide variety of information including airline schedules , horoscopes , and classified ads ( InfoLine ) . GameLine ceased operations before any of these expanded services were offered , though StockLine and SportsLine were reportedly near complete implementation . Control Video Corporation was one of many smaller companies that went bust in the video game crash of 1983. # Legacy # Even though the GameLine was discontinued , the investors and founding members of CVC went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the technological infrastructure they had built . The company , named Quantum Computer Services , was created by Steve Case , among others . This company created a service named Quantum Link which linked together Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 users offering many of the expanded services originally envisioned for GameLine . Quantum Computer Services eventually became America Online in October 1991 , which became extremely successful during the 1990s , and was eventually merged with Time Warner in 2001 , but was spun-off a few years later . Though the company still technically exists , support for the GameLine does not . The game titled ' ' Save The Whales ' ' was exclusive to the GameLine and although it was never released on a cartridge , a prototype was found in early 2002. # Game list # GameLine offered the following games : * ' ' Airlock ' ' * ' ' Alien ' ' * ' ' Atlantis ' ' * ' ' Bank Heist ' ' * ' ' Bermuda Triangle ' ' * ' ' Boing ' ' * ' ' Bugs ' ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' * ' ' Coconuts ' ' * ' ' Commando Raid ' ' * ' ' Cosmic Ark ' ' * ' ' Cosmic Creeps ' ' * ' ' Cosmic Swarm ' ' * ' ' Cross Force ' ' * ' ' Crypts of Chaos ' ' * ' ' Deadly Duck ' ' * ' ' Demolition Herby ' ' * ' ' Demon Attack ' ' * ' ' Dragonfire ' ' * ' ' The Earth Dies Screaming ' ' * ' ' Eggomania ' ' * ' ' Encounter At L-5 ' ' * ' ' Entombed ' ' * ' ' Fantastic Voyage ' ' * ' ' Fast Food ' ' * ' ' Fire Fighter ' ' * ' ' Flash Gordon ' ' * ' ' Frankenstein 's Monster ' ' * ' ' Gangster Alley ' ' * ' ' Gopher ' ' * ' ' Guardian ' ' * ' ' Infiltrate ' ' * ' ' Jawbreaker ' ' * ' ' King Kong ' ' * ' ' Lost Luggage ' ' * ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' * ' ' M*A*S*H ' ' * ' ' Megaforce ' ' * ' ' Mines of Minos ' ' * ' ' Moonsweeper ' ' * ' ' Name This Game ' ' * ' ' Nexar ' ' * ' ' Nightmare ' ' * ' ' No Escape ' ' * ' ' Picnic ' ' * ' ' Piece O ' Cake ' ' * ' ' Planet Patrol ' ' * ' ' Polaris ' ' * ' ' Porky 's ' ' * ' ' Raft Rider ' ' * ' ' Ram It ' ' * ' ' Revenge of the Beefsteak Tomatoes ' ' * ' ' Riddle of the Sphinx ' ' * ' ' Room Of Doom ' ' * ' ' Save The Whales ' ' * ' ' Shark Attack ' ' * ' ' Shootin ' Gallery ' ' * ' ' Sneak &amp;amp ; Peek ' ' * ' ' Solar Storm ' ' * ' ' Space Cavern ' ' * ' ' Space Jockey ' ' * ' ' Spacemaster X-7 ' ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' * ' ' Stargunner ' ' * ' ' Star Voyager ' ' * ' ' Tape Worm ' ' * ' ' Threshold ' ' * ' ' Towering Inferno ' ' * ' ' Trick Shot ' ' * ' ' Turmoil ' ' * ' ' Warplock ' ' * ' ' Word Zapper ' ' * ' ' Worm War I ' ' # See also # * Intellivision 's PlayCable * Sega Genesis 's Sega Channel * Super Famicom 's Satellaview , and Nintendo Power cartridges * XBAND , a third party online game network and service for the Super NES and Sega Genesis created and run by Catapult * Nintendo Entertainment System 's Famicom Modem * Teleplay Modem , a third party modem made for the NES , Super NES , and Sega Genesis
