The legendary building has a rich history of notable performances , and is being restored by a local nonprofit organization . # History # The original structure that would become the home of the Ritz Theater was constructed in 1883 at 107 Broadway in Newburgh , New York . The address had been the site of other ventures that offered some of lifes small luxuries : George Barnes plumbing business .. a cigar factory .. and even a champagne factory. # 1900s # In 1913 , the intended manufacturing building was purchased by George Cohen , a Poughkeepsie entrepreneur , and was named Cohens Opera House .

Although the Ritz Theater continued to show movies , in the 1960s both the City of Newburgh and its once highly popular street of Broadway entered a slow decline that affected the theater as well as the city . The popular city of Newburgh was no longer as frequented as it once was as the ferry closed , and I-84 as well as the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge by-passed the downtown area of Newburgh . In October 1969 , the Ritz Theater was closed , and the theater became a movie house containing two cinemas .
