Automatic Terminal Information Service , or ATIS , is a continuous broadcast of recorded ' ' noncontrol ' ' aeronautical information in busier terminal ( i.e. airport ) areas . ATIS broadcasts contain essential information , such as weather information , which runways are active , available approaches , and any other information required by the pilots , such as important NOTAMs . Pilots usually listen to an available ATIS broadcast before contacting the local control unit , in order to reduce the controllers ' workload and relieve frequency congestion . The recording is updated in fixed intervals or when there is a significant change in the information , e.g. a change in the active runway . It is given a letter designation ( e.g. ' ' bravo ' ' ) from the ICAO spelling alphabet . The letter progresses down the alphabet with every update and starts at ' ' alpha ' ' after a break in service of 12 hours or more . When contacting the local control unit , a pilot will indicate he/she has information  , where  is the ATIS identification letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATC controller to verify whether the pilot has all the current information . # Sample messages # # Example 1 # See METAR for a more in-depth explanation of aviation weather messages and terminology . # Example 2 # On tuning to an ATIS frequency , a pilot might hear : : ' ' Vancouver International information Bravo one three five five Zulu weather . Wind three zero zero at eight , visibility five . Five hundred few , one thousand two hundred scattered , ceiling three thousand overcast , temperature one five , dew-point eight . Altimeter two niner eight seven . IFR approach is ILS or visual , runway two six left and runway two six right . Simultaneous parallel ILS approaches in use . Departures , runway two six left . GPS approaches available . VFR aircraft say direction of flight . All aircraft read back all hold short instructions . Advise controller on initial contact that you have Bravo . ' ' This translates to : : Vancouver International Airport , the information Bravo is issued at 13:55 UTC . The winds are from 300 ( northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 500 feet there are few clouds , at 1,200 there are scattered clouds , at 3,000 feet there is an overcast cloud ceiling . The temperature is 15C ( some airports do n't include this due to variability ) . The dew point is 8C . The altimeter setting is 29.87 inches of mercury ( however this could also be expressed in millibars or hectopascals ) . Visual and simultaneous ILS landings available using Instrument Flight Rules , using runways 26L and 26R , while departures may use runway 26L . You can conduct an approach via a GPS system . When you first contact air traffic control , inform them your direction of flight if you are using Visual Flight Rules . Any hold short instructions the controller gives you need to be read back to the controller to confirm you have received them properly . Finally , inform the controller that you have information Bravo ( i.e. this information ) when you first talk to him or her . # System operation # The ATIS at an airport is usually given by an automated voice , this allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATIS message instead of making a time-consuming voice recording , although at some smaller , less busy airports with a control tower , it may be made by a controller and not a computer . Most airports in a certain country will often have the same ATIS format or layout with the same automated voice . For example , all ATIS information at major airports in the United Kingdom such as Heathrow , Gatwick , Manchester , Birmingham , Edinburgh and even smaller ones , such as East Midlands and Newcastle , have a similar format or layout and are all given by the same automated voice . # Luton information Oscar , time 1250 . Runway in use 26 . Expect an ILS approach . Surface wind 230 8 knots . Visibility 10 kilometers or more . Scattered 2,800 feet . Temperature +18 . Dewpoint +10 . QNH 1016 . Threshold QFE 997 hectopascal . Transition level flight level 60 . Departing aircraft should make initial contact with Luton ground on 121.750 . Acknowledge receipt of information Oscar and advise aircraft type on first contact . # # Stansted information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expect an ILS approach . Ground is open . Delivery is closed . Surface wind 230 8 knots . Visibility 10 kilometers or more . Scattered 2,800 feet . Temperature +18 . Dewpoint +10 . QNH 1016 . Transition level flight level 60 . Acknowledge receipt of information Oscar and advise aircraft type on first contact . # As Heathrow and Manchester airports both have two runways and both airports use one for arrivals and the other for departures , they have two ATIS frequencies , one for arrivals and one for departures . Manchester only uses its second runway part-time however both ATIS frequencies still remain active when only one runway is active , both ATIS services will have a recorded message saying single runway operations after it gives the runway in use when this is the case . # Technical background # ATIS systems can be classified into solid-state and PC-based . Solid-state ATIS systems are microcontroller-powered devices that incorporate speech synthesis and data processing in a single piece of proprietary equipment , while PC-ATIS systems are based on COTS-hardware , like normal rack-mounted PCs with multiple high-performance soundcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D-ATIS ) . D-ATIS is a text-based , digitally transmitted version of the ATIS audio broadcast . It is accessed via a data link service such as the ACARS and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft . D-ATIS is incorporated on the aircraft as part of its electronic system , such as an EFB or an FMS . D-ATIS may be incorporated into the core ATIS system , or be realized as a separate system with a data interface between voice ATIS and D-ATIS.
