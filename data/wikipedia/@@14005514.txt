Jonathan Edward Caldwell ( born March 24 , 1883 , date of death unknown ) was a self-taught aeronautical engineer who designed a series of bizarre aircraft and started public companies in order to finance their construction . None of these was ever successful , and after his last known attempt in the later 1930s he disappeared , apparently to avoid securities fraud charges . His name was later connected with mythical German flying saucers , and he remains a fixture of the UFO genre to this day . Little of Caldwell 's early life is known , and what has been documented was reconstructed from college records . He appears to have been born in Hensall , Ontario , Canada , the fifth son ( and one of twelve children ) of William Thomas Caldwell ( 1848&amp;ndash ; 1930 ) and Sarah Alice Chamberlain ( 1852&amp;ndash ; 1933 ) . He emigrated to the United States in 1910 , and attended Oregon State College , from 1912 to 1913 , majoring in mechanical engineering . In the 1920s , according to statements he made later in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamentals of aerodynamics. # Cyclogyro # In February 1923 Caldwell filed for a patent on a device he called the cyclogyro . It consisted of an airplane fuselage with two paddle-wheel like attachments in place of the wings . The wheels were powered by an engine in the fuselage , spun to power the upper portion of the attachments forward &amp;ndash ; clockwise , as seen looking left from the cockpit . The wheels each featured four high aspect ratio airfoils , which were able to rotate around their horizontal axis in order to change their pitch . By changing the pitch continually through the entire rotation , the lift of the airfoils could be tuned to produce thrust in any direction . For instance , to lift off vertically the airfoils were pitched to have a positive angle of attack only at the top of their rotation , just generating lift only at that point . In forward flight the angle at the top of the arc would be reduced to make the lift neutral , but they would retain their positive angle even through the forward part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle in this fashion , the aircraft could be lifted in any direction , with differential thrust between the two wings allowing yaw to be applied . Caldwell formed Gravity Aeroplane Company in Reno , Nevada ( Caldwell was living in Santa Monica at the time ) and issued stock in 1928 . Their company stationary included an illustration showing the cyclogyro , a version with four airfoils per wing , attached on the fuselage end to a large disk and the outer end to a cross-like support . # Ornithopter # Caldwell then turned to an even more bizarre aircraft design , an ornithopter . The wings were equipped with flexible fabric valves which were supposed to open on the upstroke and close on the downstroke , allowing it to generate lift with no forward motion and thus provide VTOL service , like the cyclogyro . Caldwell , now living in Denver filed a patent on his new design in December 1927 , which was finally granted as US1730758 in October 1929 . In early 1928 he started another company in Nevada to raise funds to develop it , Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of stock at ten cents per share , retaining a 51 percent interest . The funds were used to develop a human-powered prototype . By 1931 there was still no working prototype , and Caldwell moved to Orangeburg , New York , and later to Madison , New Jersey . A January 14 , 1932 newsreel film shows the ornithopter being readied for a test . This was apparently attempted without success , by the otherwise unknown Emile Harrier . Additional funds were then raised by another stock issue in order to build a full-sized prototype at Teterboro Airport . He also apparently restarted his cyclogyro work , and an article appeared in one of the Popular Mechanics-like magazines showing the design equipped with a V-8 engine mounted in an odd twin-fuselage with the pilot and passengers below . Before the ornithopter prototype could be completed , the New Jersey Assistant Attorney General charged Caldwell with fraud in September . In his notes , the Attorney , Robert Grossman , noted that no one connected with the company possessed sufficient knowledge of aeronautics to build a practical ship . Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ornithopter prototype until December , as long as no more shares of stock were sold in that time . Grossman also noted that Caldwell had begun work on yet another entirely new design , using a disk wing . In December there was still no prototype , and Caldwell moved the company to New York . The New York Attorney General started questioning the business almost immediately . # Autogyro # In 1934 Caldwell moved again , this time to Washington , DC . In a filing with the Maryland Securities and Exchange Commission he described the company as working solely on a new type of autogyro , which he referred to as a disk-rotor plane . The design consisted of a fairly conventional autogyro layout , but the wing was disk-like instead of the more traditional helicopter-like bladed assembly . The disk had airfoils formed out of fabric on the inside of the rim , and four small solid surfaces on the outside . In forward motion the airstream blowing across the four small surfaces would spin the disk , which would provide lift from the fabric airfoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be braked to stop it spinning , and unbraked again for a near-vertical landing . The advantage to this arrangement was that there was no theoretical limit on forward speed , whereas a conventional autogyro can not be stopped in flight , and has a limit when the speed of the rearward moving blade approaches the stall speed . Unlike his previous attempts , the disk-rotor aircraft was actually completed between 1936 and 1938 , and was issued a CAA experimental registration number ' ' NX99Y ' ' . In late 1937 or early 1938 a test flight was attempted with the company mechanic at the controls , Willard Driggers . According to later claims ( see below ) , Driggers managed to get the aircraft airborne from the Benning Race Track , and in a panic cut power , causing the aircraft to crash-land , damaging the landing gear . Although damage was minor , Caldwell had apparently already lost interest in the design and did not repair it . # Another autogyro # In 1939 Caldwell shut down Grey Goose and swapped shares once again , forming Rotor Planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earlier autogyro , but replaced the fuselage with a smaller disk in the center . According to some accounts , around 1940 the Maryland securities commission also started examining Caldwell , who promptly disappeared , abandoning the broken disk-rotor and the partially completed rotorplane. # The USAF investigates # In May 1949 , officers of the U.S. Air Force 's Project Sign received a letter from a Gray Goose shareholder , who explained that the company had been building aircraft similar to the flying saucers which were then a popular topic in the press . This was during the UFO craze following Kenneth Arnold 's reports of seeing UFO 's over Mount Rainier and the Roswell Incident that followed . The Air Force had canvassed for reports of flying saucers , and the shareholder apparently felt that Caldwell 's disk-rotor might explain them . Tracking down the leads , the team , accompanied by the Maryland Police , visited an abandoned farm in Glen Burnie , Maryland ( outside Baltimore ) , where the damaged remains of Caldwell 's disk-rotor aircraft were discovered . They also tracked down Driggers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937/8 . The team reported that the prototypes could not be responsible for the flying saucer reports that were being received from all around the country . Photographs of the broken disk-rotor machine continue to appear in UFOs books to this day . They were often described as crashed flying saucers in earlier works , claiming it was one more example of the USAF being in possession of such vehicles . More recently they are normally connected with the claims that the Nazis had built working flying saucers late in the war , lumped together with other disk-shaped aircraft like the Avrocar , Arthur Sack A.S.6 and Vought V-173 , in an effort to demonstrate that such aircraft were both possible and well-researched. # Personal life # In 1909/10 , Caldwell married Olive E Davis . Caldwell emigrated to the United States in 1910 . In 1930 , Caldwell was living in Denver with his wife , Olive E Caldwell ( 48 , born Wisconsin ) and son Carl Davis Caldwell ( July 17 , 1917 , Montana &amp;ndash ; November 27 , 1993 , Cupertino , California ) .
