Spirituals ( or Negro spirituals ) are religious ( generally Christian ) songs that were created by enslaved African people in the United States . # Terminology and origin # The term ' ' spiritual ' ' is derived from ' ' spiritual song . ' ' The King James Bible 's translation of Ephesians 5:19 says : Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord . The term spiritual song was often used in the black and white Christian community through the 19th century ( and indeed much earlier ) , and spiritual was used as a noun to mean , according to the context , spiritual person or spiritual thing , but not specifically with regard to song . ' ' Negro spiritual ' ' first appears in print in the 1860s , where slaves are described as using ' ' spirituals ' ' for religious songs sung sitting or standing in place , and ' ' spiritual shouts ' ' for more dance-like music . Musicologist George Pullen Jackson extended the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk hymnody , as in his 1938 book ' ' White Spirituals in the Southern Uplands ' ' , but this does not appear to have been widespread usage previously . The term , however , has often been broadened to include subsequent arrangements into more standard European-American hymnodic styles , and to include post-emancipation songs with stylistic similarities to the original Negro spirituals . Although numerous rhythmical and sonic elements of Negro spirituals can be traced to African sources , Negro spirituals are a musical form that is indigenous and specific to the religious experience in the United States of Africans and their descendants . They are a result of the interaction of music and religion from Africa with music and religion of European origin . Further , this interaction occurred only in the United States . Africans who converted to Christianity in other parts of the world , even in the Caribbean and Latin America , did not evolve this form . There is also a duality in the lyrics of spirituals . They communicated many Christian ideals while also communicating the hardship that was a result of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the composer 's life . It was a way of sharing religious , emotional , and physical experience through song . # Alternative interpretations # Some scholarship claims that songs such as Wade in the Water contained explicit instructions to fugitive slaves on how to avoid capture , and on which routes to take to successfully make their way to freedom . Wade in the Water allegedly recommends leaving dry land and taking to the water as a strategy to throw pursuing bloodhounds off one 's trail . The Gospel Train , Song of the Free , and Swing Low , Sweet Chariot are likewise supposed to contain veiled references to the Underground Railroad , and many sources assert that Follow the Drinking Gourd contained a coded map to the Underground Railroad . The authenticity of such claims has been challenged as speculative , and critics like James Kelley have pointed to the apparent lack of primary source material in support of them . # Noted African American literary critic Sterling Allen Brown , who had interviewed former slaves and their children , was firm in his assertion in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some scholars who have found parallels between the words of Negro and white spirituals would have us believe that when the Negro sang of freedom , he meant only what the whites meant , namely freedom from sin . Free , individualistic whites on the make in a prospering civilization , nursing the American dream , could well have felt their only bondage to be that of sin , and freedom to be religious salvation . But with the drudgery , the hardships , the auction-block , the slave-mart , the shackles , and the lash so literally present in the Negro 's experience , it is hard to imagine why for the Negro they would remain figurative . The scholars certainly do not make it clear , but rather take refuge in such dicta as : The slave did not contemplate his low condition . Are we to believe that the slave singing I been rebuked , I been scorned ; done had a hard time sho 's you bawn , referred to his being outside of the true religion ? Ex-slaves , of course , inform us differently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin ( dear as that freedom was to the true believer ) but from physical bondage . Those attacking slavery as such had to be as rare as anti-Hitler marching songs in occupied France . But there were oblique references . Frederick Douglass has told us of the double-talk of the spirituals : Canaan , for instance , stood for Canada ; and over and beyond hidden satire the songs also were grapevines for communications . Harriet Tubman , herself called the Moses of her people , has told us that Go Down Moses was tabu in the slave states , but the people sang it nonetheless . # # Collections # # Jubilee Singers of Fisk University # In the 1850s , Reverend Alexander Reid , superintendent of the Spencer Academy in the old Choctaw Nation , hired some enslaved Africans from the Choctaws for some work around the school . He heard two of them , Uncle Wallace and Aunt Minerva Willis , singing religious songs that they had apparently composed . Among these were Swing Low , Sweet Chariot , Steal Away to Jesus , The Angels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan , Roll . Later , Reid , who left Indian Territory at the beginning of the Civil War , attended a musical program put on by a group of Negro singers from Fisk University . They were singing mostly popular music of the day , and Reid thought the songs he remembered from his time in the Choctaw Nation would be at least as appropriate . He and his wife transcribed the songs of the Willises as they remembered them and sent them to Fisk University . The Jubilee Singers put on their first performance singing the old captives ' songs at a religious conference in 1871 . The songs were first published in 1872 in a book entitled ' ' Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University ' ' , by Theodore F. Seward . Wallace Willis died in 1883 or 1884 . Over time , the pieces the Jubilee Singers performed came to be arranged and performed by trained musicians . In 1873 , Mark Twain , whose father had owned slaves , found Fisk singing to be in the genuine old way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' ' Peoria Journal ' ' said : they have lost the wild rhythms , the barbaric melody , the passion .. They smack of the North .. Some fifty years later , Zora Neale Hurston in her 1938 book ' ' The Sanctified Church ' ' criticized Fisk singers , and similar groups at Tuskegee and Hampton , as using a Glee Club style that was full of musicians ' tricks not to be found in the original Negro spirituals , urging readers to visit an unfashionable Negro church to experience real Negro spirituals. # Other collections # A second important early collection of lyrics is ' ' Slave Songs of the United States ' ' by William Francis Allen , Charles Pickard Ware , and Lucy McKim Garrison ( 1867 ) . A group of lyrics to Negro spirituals was published by Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson , who commanded a regiment of former slaves during the Civil War , in an article in ' ' The Atlantic Monthly ' ' and subsequently included in his 1869 memoir ' ' Army Life in a Black Regiment ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century saw a resurgence of the Spiritual . This trend was impacted strongly by composers and musical directors such as Moses Hogan and Brazeal Dennard.
