The Pacific robin ( ' ' Petroica multicolor ' ' ) , is a red-breasted Australasian robin in the passerine bird genus ' ' Petroica ' ' found on Norfolk Island , Melanesia and Polynesia . It is similar in plumage to the scarlet robin of Australia , and until recently the two were considered conspecific until split in 1999 by Schodde and Mason . 14 subspecies of Pacific robin are currently recognised , and these subspecies display considerable variation in plumage , foraging preferences and habitat . # Description # The Pacific robin is a small passerine , 11.5&amp;ndash ; 13.5 cm long and weighing 9&amp;ndash ; 11 g . Over much of its range it is the smallest species of bird . The plumage of the males and females is dimorphic , and the extent of this varies depending on the subspecies . The male of the nominate race has a black head with a white forehead , a black back and tail , and the wings are also black with a white bar . The breast and belly are red , and the lower belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and the white bar on the wing ; and the black plumage of the male is replaced by dark brown feathers instead . The breast is a duller red than the male and has more brown on the sides , and the white on the rump also smaller . Both sexes have black legs and bills . Amongst the subspecies , some males have more female-like plumage , for example ' ' P. m. femenina ' ' of central Vanuatu ; in others the female more closely resembles the male . The males of ' ' P. m. polymorpha ' ' of Makira in the Solomon Islands have two different plumage morphs , including one with no white on the forehead but an all rufous-brown head . For a complete list of the differences in subspecies plumages see below . # Distribution and habitat # The Pacific robin inhabits the islands of the south western Pacific . It ranges from Bougainville in Papua New Guinea through the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu down to Norfolk Island ( although the species is absent from New Caledonia ) and eastwards through Fiji into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there may be some small localised movements of birds in the non-breeding seasons . A fossil found on the islands of Ha'apai in Tonga show that the species once occurred in the group but is now extinct there . # Diet and feeding # Insects , spiders and pseudoscorpions make up the majority of the diet of Pacific robins . They generally feed in the lower sections of the forest , although they will ascend to the forest canopy occasionally . They will join with mixed-species feeding flocks in order to forage . Prey is obtained by aerial flycatching , gleaning , sallying and pouncing , with different populations favouring different methods . # Breeding # The Pacific robin is a seasonal breeder , although the timing of the breeding season varies across its range . Information on the timing of the season is patchy or absent in many islands . On Norfolk Island the breeding season is from September to December , and in Vanuatu the season is from October to January . Parents with young have been seen in mid August in the Solomon Islands and in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact nest which is a cup of plant fibres and spider webs . The outside of the nest is decorated with moss and lichen , and is therefore easily overlooked . The nest is usually set into a fork or stump on a tree branch , or on a horizontal branch . Around two to four eggs are laid in each clutch , with two being the typical clutch size in Norfolk Island , and two to three being typical in Fiji . The eggs are dull grey or greenish , and are incubated by the female . The nests of Pacific robins are parastised by fan-tailed cuckoos where the two species co-occur . # Threats and conservation # The Pacific robin is not considered globally threatened . Individual subspecies may be threatened by local habitat loss , and the nominate race from Norfolk Island is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and introduced species . # Taxonomy # The Pacific robin was originally described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 , from a collection in Norfolk Island . It was considered conspecific with the scarlet robin of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It forms a species group along with the scarlet robin and the tomtit of New Zealand . It is one of five red- or pink-breasted species of robin in the genus ' ' Petroica ' ' ; they are colloquially known as red robins . Although named after the European robin , is not closely related to it or the American robin . Along with the other Australian robins , it was classified for many years as a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae , before being placed in the whistler family Pachycephalidae . The robins were also placed in their own family Petroicidae , or Eopsaltridae . Sibley and Alquist 's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed the robins in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes , fairy-wrens and honeyeaters as well as crows . However , subsequent molecular research ( and current consensus ) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida ( advanced songbirds ) . # Subspecies #
