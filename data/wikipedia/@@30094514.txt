The Association for Laboratory Phonology is a non-profit professional society for researchers interested in the sound structure of language . It was founded to promote the scientific study of all aspects of phonetics and phonology of oral and sign languages through scholarly exchange across disciplines and through the use of a hybrid methodology . The founding and honorary members are Amalia Arvaniti , Mary Beckman , Cathi Best , Catherine Browman , Jennifer S. Cole , Mariapaola D'Imperio , Louis M. Goldstein , Jos Ignacio Hualde , Patricia Keating , John Kingston , D.R. Ladd , Peter Ladefoged , Janet Pierrehumbert , Caroline Smith , Paul Warren and Douglas Whalen . The Association is an international body open to scholars world-wide , and currently has over 100 members . Since the Association 's inception , the methodologies of laboratory phonology are emerging as the dominant approach to the study of sound systems in universities in North America , Europe , Australia , New Zealand , and many other locations . In this way , the success of the approach promoted by the Association for Laboratory Phonology can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , computer science , etc. , and defining the relationship between the cognitive and physical aspects of human speech as a question of cognitive science . # Meetings # The biennial Conference on Laboratory Phonology ( LabPhon ) brings together researchers across the many relevant disciplines to present work on the phonological patterns and structures of natural languages . All oral paper sessions are plenary , and are organized to promote discussion across the disciplines . Each session groups together invited and submitted talks on a conference theme and ends with a talk by an invited discussant followed by an open discussion by the entire conference audience . Since the second conference in 1989 , there have also been one or more poster sessions , which also are plenary . Conferences generally have between four and six themes , which are broadly defined in order to bring together speakers and commentators from different disciplines and theoretical backgrounds . # Publications # The proceedings of the Conference on Laboratory Phonology were published as Papers in Laboratory Phonology by Cambridge University Press from 1991 ( Vol 1 ) to 2004 ( Vol 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renamed to Laboratory Phonology and published by Mouton de Gruyter . After the publication of Laboratory Phonology 10 in 2010 , the book series was replaced by the journal Laboratory Phonology . The journal encompasses the scientific study of the elements of oral language , their organization , their grammatical function , and their role in speech communication . Research questions and some of the methods addressed in the publications also extend naturally to the parallel investigation of manual signs as the encoding elements of sign languages . # Proceedings # *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume I : Between the Grammar and Physics of Speech *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume II : Gesture , Segment , Prosody *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume III : Phonological Structure and Phonetic Form *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume IV : Phonology and Phonetic Evidence *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume V : Acquisition and the Lexicon *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume VI : Phonetic Interpretation *Laboratory Phonology 7 *Laboratory Phonology 8 *Laboratory Phonology 9 *Laboratory Phonology 10 # Executive Council # *D .
