The 2010 FIBA World Championship , hosted by Turkey , was the international basketball competition contested by the men 's national teams . The tournament ran from August 28 to September 12 , 2010 . It was co-organized by the International Basketball Federation ( FIBA ) , Turkish Basketball Federation and the 2010 Organizing Committee . It was considered as prestigious a competition as the Olympic Basketball Tournament . For the third time ( after the 1986 and 2006 tournaments ) , the World Championship had 24 competing nations . As a result , the group stage games were played in four different cities , and the knockout round was hosted by Istanbul . The United States won the tournament for their fourth time after going undefeated in the Opening Round and beating host Turkey in the final . The draw for the Championship took place on December 15 , 2009 in Istanbul . Teams were drawn into four preliminary round groups of six teams each .

Most other teams secured their places in continental qualifying tournaments ( three from Africa , three from Asia , two from Oceania , four from the Americas , and six from Europe ) . FIBA invited four wild card teams to fill out the twenty-four team field . # Wild cards # The four wild cards were determined by FIBA through criteria . For example , a team must have played in the Zone 's qualification tournament to receive recommendation . Also , in order for every team to have an opportunity for a wild card , a maximum of three teams from any Zone can be allotted a wild card entry .

Both Greek coach Jonas Kazlauskas and Serbian coach Duan Ivkovi criticized FIBA for waiting until less than 48 hours before the tournament over a week after the brawl to announce the suspensions , citing the unfairness of playing shorthanded for the first games . Greece eventually won their first two games in spite of the suspensions , while Serbia won two of their first three games . # Bamberg Super Cup # # Preliminary round # The top four finishers in each of the four preliminary round groups advanced to the sixteen team , single-elimination knockout stage , where Group A teams would meet Group B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the most successful in the first round , as nine of the ten teams advanced to the knockout stage ( only Germany did not progress ) .
