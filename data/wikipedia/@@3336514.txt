International inequality is inequality between countries ( cf. Milanovic 2002 ) . Economic differences between rich and poor countries are considerable . According to the United Nations Human Development Report 2004 , the GDP per capita in countries with high , medium and low human development ( a classification based on the UN Human Development Index ) was 24,806 , 4,269 and 1,184 PPP$ , respectively ( PPP$ = purchasing power parity measured in United States dollars ) . # International wealth distribution # A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000 , and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total . The bottom half of the world adult population owned barely 1% of global wealth . Extensive statistics , many indicating the growing world disparity , are included in the available report , press releases , Excel tables and Powerpoint slides . The major component of the world 's income inequality ( the global Gini coefficient ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks by Quah 1997 ) . * The first group has 13% of the world 's population and receives 45% of the world 's PPP income . This group includes the United States , Japan , Germany , the United Kingdom , France , Australia and Canada , and comprises 500 million people with an annual income level over 11,500 PPP$. *The second group has 42% of the world 's population and receives only 9% of the world PPP income . This group includes India , Indonesia and rural China , and comprises 2,100 million people with an income level under 1,000 PPP$ . ( See Milanovic 2001 , p. 38 ) . Economic inequality very closely matches lognormal distribution as one traverses the strata of national and world societies from top-to-bottom . During the 20th century there was considerable divergence between the economic wealth of developed and developing countries . Richer countries like the United States and many European countries converged together towards a GDP per capita much greater than developing countries such as India and Ethiopia . The evolution of the income gap between poor and rich countries is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency for poorer countries to grow faster than richer ones and , hence , for their levels of income to converge . Convergence is a matter of current research and debate , but most studies have shown lack of evidence for absolute convergence based on comparisons among countries ( with regard to this debate see for instance Cole and Newmayer ( 2003 ) or ) . According to current research , global income inequality peaked approximately in the 1970s when world income was distributed bimodally into rich and poor countries with little overlap . Since then inequality have been rapidly decreasing , and this trend seems to be accelerating . Income distribution is now unimodal , with most people living in middle-income countries . World inequality is however increasing , possibly because of increase of within-countries inequalities # Comparisons # Some of the economic disparities among nations can be better appreciated when rich and poor countries or societies are contrasted . For example , with regard to income inequality , according to some estimates by Branko Milanovic from the World Bank : * An American having the average income of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Milanovic 2002 , p. 50 ) * The top 10 percent of the US population has an aggregate income equal to income of the poorest 43 percent of people in the world , or differently put , total income of the richest 25 million Americans is equal to total income of almost 2 billion people . ( Milanovic 2002 , p. 50 ) With regard to wealth inequality ( researchers defined wealth as the value of physical and financial assets minus debts ) , a 2006 report with data from 2000 concluded that : * India dominates the bottom third of the global wealth distribution , contributing a little under a third ( 27 per cent to be precise ) of this group . The middle third of the distribution is the domain of China which supplies more than a third of those in deciles 4-8 . At the top end , North America , Europe and high-income Asia monopolise the top decile , each regional group accounting for around one third of the richest wealth holders ( Davies et al . 2006 , p. 27 ) * the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global household wealth , so that the average member of this group has 8.5 times the global average holding . The corresponding figures for the top 5 per cent , top 2 per cent , and top 1 per cent are 71 per cent ( 14.2 times the average ) , 51 per cent ( 25 times the average ) and 40 per cent ( 40 times the average ) , respectively . This compares with the bottom half of the distribution which collectively owns barely 1 per cent of global wealth . Thus the top 1 per cent own almost 40 times as much as the bottom 50 per cent . The contrast with the bottom decile of wealth holders is even starker . The average member of the top decile nearly 3000 times the mean wealth of the bottom decile , and the average member of the top percentile is more than 13,000 times richer . ( Davies et al . 2006 , p. 26 ) * for the world as a whole the share of the top 10 per cent was 85 per cent in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Davies et al . 2006 , p. 32 ) * only $2161 was needed in order to belong to the top half of the world wealth distribution , but to be a member of the top 10 per cent required at least $61,000 and membership of the top 1 per cent required more than $500,000 per adult . ( Davies et al . 2006 , p. 25 ) James Davies , Professor of Economics at the University of Western Ontario , and one of the authors of the report , said : Income inequality has been rising for the past 20 to 25 years and we think that is true for inequality in the distribution of wealth . There is a group of problems in developing countries that make it difficult for people to build assets , which are important , since life is so precarious . Other disparities can be better appreciated when rich individuals ( or corporations ) are compared against poor individuals . According to some estimates , for instance : * The richest 1 percent of people in the world receive as much as the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 million richest people receive as much as 2.7 billion poor . ( Milanovic 2002 , p. 50 ) * The ' ' three ' ' richest people possess more financial assets than the poorest 10% of the world 's population , combined .  Link broken  . * As of May 2005 , the three richest people in the world have total assets that exceed the annual combined gross domestic product of the 47 countries with the least GDP , ( calculation based on data from list of countries by GDP ( PPP ) and list of billionaires ) ( Annan , 1998 ) * As of May 2005 , the 125 richest people in the world have assets that exceed the annual combined gross domestic product of all the least developed countries ( calculation based on data from list of countries by GDP ( PPP ) and list of billionaires ) . # Further facts # Wealth : * 6% of the world population own 52% of the global assets . The richest 2% of the world population own more than 51% of the global assets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% of the world population own less than 1% of the global assets . * The whole global assets volume is about 125 trillion US$. * 1,125 Dollar-Billionaires own 4.4 trillion US$ . They own 4 times more than the 50% poor people of the world . * over 80% of the world population lives on less than 10 US$/day. ; over 50% of the world population lives on less than 2 US$/day ; over 20% of the world population lives on less than 1.25 US$/day Income : * In 2005 , 43% of the world population ( 3.14 billion people ) have an income of less than U.S. $2.5/day. 21.5% of the world population ( 1.4 billion people ) have an income of less than US$1.25/day. * In 1981 , 60.4% of the world population ( 2.73 billion people ) had an income of less than US$ 2.5/day and 42.2% of the world population ( 1.91 billion people ) had an income of less than US$ 1.25 /day . But first of all these improvements were reached in China . In all other developing countries only the percents decreased ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased . * In 2008 , 17% of the people in the developing countries are on the verge of starvation . * The proportion of poor people ( with less than US$ 3,470 per year ) is 78% . The proportion of rich people ( with more than US$ 8,000/year ) is 11% . Welfare spending : If East Asia and southern Latin American countries are taken out of the equation , the differences in government spending between the industrialized and developing states are striking , with the latter registering extremely low levels of spending . * Social expenditure as a proportion for GDP for Indonesia or the Dominican Republic registers around the 2-3 per cent mark , compared to Sweden or France which at the moment hover just under the 30 per cent mark . * In contrast to the industrialized states , from 1980 to 1990 many southern states experienced a decline in social spending as a percentage of overall government spending . Therefore , in contrast to the North , the developing states are far more vulnerable to the pressures arising from economic globalization . Overall , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions registering just a few per cent of GDP . However , some people argue that decrease in welfare spending is not an issue of global inequality but rather a common phenomenon in an era of globalization. # Schools of thought on economic inequality # There are various schools of thought regarding economic inequality . Marxism favors an eventual society where distribution is based on an individual 's needs rather than social class or other such factors . Meritocracy favors an eventual society where an individual 's success is a direct function of contribution reflecting an individual 's skills and effort , and detrimental ( this is a value judgement ) inasmuch as it represent inherited or unjustified wealth or opportunities . Classical liberals and libertarians generally do not take a stance on wealth inequality , but believe in equality under the law regardless of whether it leads to unequal wealth distribution . Arguments based on social justice favor a more equal distribution making claims economic inequality weakens societies , although counter-arguments are made that inequality might benefit societies .
