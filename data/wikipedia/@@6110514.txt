Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing ( RM-ODP ) is a reference model in computer science , which provides a co-ordinating framework for the standardization of open distributed processing ( ODP ) . It supports distribution , interworking , platform and technology independence , and portability , together with an enterprise architecture framework for the specification of ODP systems . RM-ODP , also named ' ' ITU-T Rec . X.901-X.904 ' ' and ' ' ISO/IEC 10746 ' ' , is a joint effort by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) and the Telecommunication Standardization Sector ( ITU-T ) . # Overview # The RM-ODP is a reference model based on precise concepts derived from current distributed processing developments and , as far as possible , on the use of formal description techniques for specification of the architecture . Many RM-ODP concepts , possibly under different names , have been around for a long time and have been rigorously described and explained in exact philosophy ( for example , in the works of Mario Bunge ) and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedrich Hayek ) . Some of these conceptssuch as abstraction , composition , and emergencehave recently been provided with a solid mathematical foundation in category theory . RM-ODP has four fundamental elements : * an object modelling approach to system specification ; * the specification of a system in terms of separate but interrelated viewpoint specifications ; * the definition of a system infrastructure providing distribution transparencies for system applications ; and * a framework for assessing system conformance . The RM-ODP family of recommendations and international standards defines a system of interrelated essential concepts necessary to specify open distributed processing systems and provides a well-developed enterprise architecture framework for structuring the specifications for any large-scale systems including software systems . # History # Much of the preparatory work that led into the adoption of RM-ODP as an ISO standard was carried out by the Advanced Networked Systems Architecture ( ANSA ) project . This ran from 1984 until 1998 under the leadership of Andrew Herbert ( now MD of Microsoft Research in Cambridge ) , and involved a number of major computing and telecommunication companies . Parts 2 and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 . Parts 1 and 4 were adopted in 1998. # RM-ODP Topics # # RM-ODP standards # RM-ODP consists of four basic ITU-T Recommendations and ISO/IEC International Standards : # Overview : Contains a motivational overview of ODP , giving scoping , justification and explanation of key concepts , and an outline of the ODP architecture . It contains explanatory material on how the RM-ODP is to be interpreted and applied by its users , who may include standard writers and architects of ODP systems . # Foundations : Contains the definition of the concepts and analytical framework for normalized description of ( arbitrary ) distributed processing systems . It introduces the principles of conformance to ODP standards and the way in which they are applied . In only 18 pages , this standard sets the basics of the whole model in a clear , precise and concise way . # Architecture : Contains the specification of the required characteristics that qualify distributed processing as open . These are the constraints to which ODP standards must conform . This recommendation also defines RM-ODP viewpoints , subdivisions of the specification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of information relevant to some particular area of concern . # Architectural Semantics : Contains a formalization of the ODP modeling concepts by interpreting many concepts in terms of the constructs of the different standardized formal description techniques . # Viewpoints modeling and the RM-ODP framework # Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no single individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications . Furthermore , we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system 's specifications . A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer . The concept of RM-ODP viewpoints framework , therefore , is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system . These viewpoints each satisfy an audience with interest in a particular set of aspects of the system . Associated with each viewpoint is a viewpoint language that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint . Viewpoint modeling has become an effective approach for dealing with the inherent complexity of large distributed systems . Current software architectural practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into several areas of concerns , each one focusing on a specific aspect of the system . Examples include the 4+1 view model , the Zachman Framework , TOGAF , DoDAF and , of course , RM-ODP . A viewpoint is a subdivision of the specification of a complete system , established to bring together those particular pieces of information relevant to some particular area of concern during the analysis or design of the system . Although separately specified , the viewpoints are not completely independent ; key items in each are identified as related to items in the other viewpoints . Moreover , each viewpoint substantially uses the same foundational concepts ( defined in Part 2 of RM-ODP ) . However , the viewpoints are sufficiently independent to simplify reasoning about the complete specification . The mutual consistency among the viewpoints is ensured by the architecture defined by RM-ODP , and the use of a common object model provides the glue that binds them all together . More specifically , the RM-ODP framework provides five generic and complementary viewpoints on the system and its environment : * The ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scope and policies for the system . It describes the business requirements and how to meet them . * The ' ' information viewpoint ' ' , which focuses on the semantics of the information and the information processing performed . It describes the information managed by the system and the structure and content type of the supporting data . * The ' ' computational viewpoint ' ' , which enables distribution through functional decomposition on the system into objects which interact at interfaces . It describes the functionality provided by the system and its functional decomposition . * The ' ' engineering viewpoint ' ' , which focuses on the mechanisms and functions required to support distributed interactions between objects in the system . It describes the distribution of processing performed by the system to manage the information and provide the functionality . * The ' ' technology viewpoint ' ' , which focuses on the choice of technology of the system . It describes the technologies chosen to provide the processing , functionality and presentation of information . # RM-ODP and UML # Currently there is growing interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no widely agreed approach to the structuring of such specifications . This adds to the cost of adopting the use of UML for system specification , hampers communication between system developers and makes it difficult to relate or merge system specifications where there is a need to integrate IT systems . Although the ODP reference model provides abstract languages for the relevant concepts , it does not prescribe particular notations to be used in the individual viewpoints . The viewpoint languages defined in the reference model are abstract languages in the sense that they define what concepts should be used , not how they should be represented . This lack of precise notations for expressing the different models involved in a multi-viewpoint specification of a system is a common feature for most enterprise architectural approaches , including the Zachman Framework , the 4+1 model , or the RM-ODP . These approaches were consciously defined in a notation- and representation-neutral manner to increase their use and flexibility . However , this makes more difficult , among other things , the development of industrial tools for modeling the viewpoint specifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible derivation of implementations from the system specifications . In order to address these issues , ISO/IEC and the ITU-T started a joint project in 2004 : ITU-T Rec . X.906ISO/IEC 19793 : Information technology - Open distributed processing - Use of UML for ODP system specifications . This document ( usually referred to as ) defines use of the Unified Modeling Language 2 ( UML 2 ; ISO/IEC 19505 ) , for expressing the specifications of open distributed systems in terms of the viewpoint specifications defined by the RM-ODP . It defines a set of UML Profiles , one for each viewpoint language and one to express the correspondences between viewpoints , and an approach for structuring them according to the RM-ODP principles . The purpose of UML4ODP to allow ODP modelers to use the UML notation for expressing their ODP specifications in a standard graphical way ; to allow UML modelers to use the RM-ODP concepts and mechanisms to structure their large UML system specifications according to a mature and standard proposal ; and to allow UML tools to be used to process viewpoint specifications , thus facilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large software systems . In addition , ITU-T Rec . X.906 ISO/IEC 19793 enables the seamless integration of the RM-ODP enterprise architecture framework with the Model-Driven Architecture ( MDA ) initiative from the OMG , and with the service-oriented architecture ( SOA ) . # Applications # In addition , there are several projects that have used or currently use RM-ODP for effectively structuring their systems specifications : * The COMBINE project * The Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems ( RASDS ) From the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems . * Interoperability Technology Association for Information Processing ( INTAP ) , Japan . * The Synapses European project . # See also # * Enterprise Architecture framework * Enterprise Collaboration Architecture * Enterprise Modelling Methodology/Open Distributed Processing ( EMM/ODP ) * Reference model * Triune Continuum Paradigm * View model * ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 # Notes and references #
