The following year saw the first English-language commentary of the race , however unlike the Le Mans commentary this did not run for the full 24 hours but stopped for six hours during the night . That year the race itself stopped for a time during the night as thick fog caused a red flag period . The Nrburgring 24 hours was successful enough that it has been repeated in 2008 and 2009 , but using the same format of covering the first ten , and final eight hours of the race , rather than the full 24 hours . However , in 2010 the entire race was broadcast live with John Hindhaugh , Paul Truswell and Graham Goodwin pulling out almost an 24-hour live shift . Same was repeated in 2011 , with Jim Roller joining the commentary trio once again .
