Often within seven miles of the front line , they were considered extremely dangerous , and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military . As a result of its proximity to the front , the station would often come under enemy attack , as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August . The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces , with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs .
