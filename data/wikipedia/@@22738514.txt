The Scott Trial is a British motorcycle trials competition dating from 1914 run over an off-road course of approximately 70 miles . One of the most challenging trials events in the UK , its appeal is to clubman riders as well as international professional riders . The Scott raises money for the Scott charities , a range of local non-profit making organisations . # History # The Scott Trial began in 1914 when Alfred Angas Scott , inventor and founder of the Scott Motorcycle Company challenged the workers at his factory to ride from the factory in Shipley through the Yorkshire Dales to Burnsall , a riverside village near Grassington . Of the 14 starters only 9 finished . The event was reintroduced after the First World War in 1919 and although Alfred Scott died in 1923 the event continued to be run by the Scott workers until 1926 .
