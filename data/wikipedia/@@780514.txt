Spanish grammar is the grammar of the Spanish language ( ' ' espaol , castellano ' ' ) , which is a Romance language that originated in north central Spain and is spoken today throughout Spain , some twenty countries in the Americas , and Equatorial Guinea . Spanish is an inflected language . The verbs are potentially marked for tense , aspect , mood , person , and number ( resulting in some fifty conjugated forms per verb ) . The nouns form a two-gender system and are marked for number . Pronouns can be inflected for person , number , gender ( including a residual neuter ) , and case , although the Spanish pronominal system represents a simplification of the ancestral Latin system . Spanish was the first of the European vernaculars to have a grammar treatise , ' ' Gramtica de la lengua castellana ' ' , written in 1492 by the Andalusian linguist Antonio de Nebrija and presented to Isabella of Castile at Salamanca . The Real Academia Espaola ( RAE ) traditionally dictates the normative rules of the Spanish language , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Spanish are remarkably few , and someone who has learned the dialect of one area will have no difficulties using reasonably formal speech in the other ; however , pronunciation does vary , as well as grammar and vocabulary . Recently published comprehensive Spanish reference grammars in English include , , and . # Verbs # Every Spanish verb belongs to one of three form classes , characterized by the infinitive ending : ' ' -ar ' ' , ' ' -er ' ' , or ' ' -ir ' ' sometimes called the first , second , and third conjugations , respectively . A Spanish verb has nine indicative tenses with more-or-less direct English equivalents : the present tense ( ' I walk ' ) , the preterite ( ' I walked ' ) , the imperfect ( ' I was walking ' or ' I used to walk ' ) , the present perfect ( ' I have walked ' ) , the past perfect also called the pluperfect ( ' I had walked ' ) , the future ( ' I will walk ' ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conditional simple ( ' I would walk ' ) and the conditional perfect ( ' I would have walked ' ) . In most dialects , each verb tense has potentially six forms , varying for first , second , or third person and for singular or plural number . In the second person , Spanish maintains the so-called T-V distinction between familiar and formal modes of address . The formal second-person pronouns ( ' ' usted ' ' , ' ' ustedes ' ' ) take third-person verb forms . The second-person familiar plural is expressed in most of Spain with the pronoun ' ' vosotros ' ' and its characteristic verb forms ( e.g. ' ' comis ' ' ' you ( plural ) eat ' ) , while in Latin American Spanish that part of the paradigm is merged with the ' ' formal ' ' second-person plural ( e.g. ' ' ustedes comen ' ' ) . In other words , in Latin America , the familiar/formal distinction in the second person is not maintained in the plural . In many areas of Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-person familiar singular pronoun ' ' t ' ' is replaced by ' ' vos ' ' , which frequently requires its own characteristic verb forms , especially in the present indicative , where the endings are ' ' -s ' ' , ' ' -s ' ' , and ' ' -s ' ' for ' ' -ar ' ' , ' ' -er ' ' , ' ' -ir ' ' verbs , respectively . See voseo . In the tables of paradigms below , the ( optional ) subject pronouns appear in parentheses. # Present indicative # The present indicative is used to express actions or states of being in a present time frame . For example : * Yo ' ' soy ' ' alto ( I ' ' am ' ' tall ) . * Ella ' ' canta ' ' en el club ( She ' ' sings ' ' in the club ) . * Todos nosotros ' ' vivimos ' ' en un submarino amarillo ( We all ' ' live ' ' in a yellow submarine ) . * ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is ' ' ten thirty ) .

The two that are simple in form ( formed with a single word , rather than being compound verbs ) are the preterite and the imperfect . # #Preterite# # The preterite is used to express actions or events that took place in the past , and which were instantaneous or are viewed as completed . For example : * Ella se muri ayer ( She died yesterday ) * Pablo apag las luces ( Pablo turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I ate the rice ) * Te cortaste el pelo ( You had your hair cut ) Preterite forms of the regular ' ' -ar ' ' verb ' ' hablar ' ' ( ' to speak ' ) : cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 !

For example : * Yo era cmico en el pasado ( I was comical in the past ) * Usted coma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence is saying You used to eat a lot , saying that in the past , the person being referred had a characteristic of eating a lot ) * Ellos escuchaban la radio ( They were listening to the radio ) All three of the sentences above describe non-instantaneous actions that are viewed as continuing in the past . The characteristic in the first sentence and the action in the second were continuous , not instantaneous occurrences .

BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Third person ( l , ella ) viva ( ellos , ellas ) vivan Note that ( 1 ) for all verbs in the imperfect , the first- and third-person singular share the same form ; and ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' verbs share the same set of endings . # #Using preterite and imperfect together# # The preterite and the imperfect can be combined in the same sentence to express the occurrence of an event in one clause during an action or state expressed in another clause . For example : * Ellos escuchaban la radio cuando oyeron un ruido afuera . ( They were listening to the radio when they heard a noise outside. ) * Yo estaba en mi cuarto cuando usted entr . ( I was in my room when you came in. ) * Era un da muy tranquilo cuando eso pas . ( It was a very peaceful day when that happened . ) In all three cases , an event or completed action interrupts an ongoing state or action . For example , in the second sentence , the speaker states that he was in his room ( expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there ) when the other person interrupted that state by entering ( expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action ) . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive both are used to express ongoing , progressive action in the present and past , respectively . For example : * Estoy haciendo mi tarea . ( I am doing my homework ) * Estamos estudiando . ( We are studying ) * Estaba escuchando la radio . ( I was listening to the radio ) * l estaba limpiando su cuarto . ( He was cleaning his room ) The present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb estar or seguir , depending on context , to the subject , and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows . The past ( imperfect ) progressive simply requires the estar or seguir to be conjugated , depending on context , in imperfect , with respect to the subject . # #Forming gerunds# # To form gerunds in an -ar verb , replace the -ar in the infinitive with -ando i.e. : jugar , hablar , caminar -- jugando , hablando , caminando For -er , or -ir verbs , replace the -er or -ir ending with -iendo i.e. : comer , escribir , dormir -- comiendo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem change , since it is an irregular verb . Verbs that end with two vowels and a consonant such as leer , traer , creer have a special exception : i.e. : leer , traer , creer -- leyendo , trayendo , creyendo Verbs that end with -eir , such as rer and sonrer have yet another exception i.e. : rer , frer -- riendo , friendo # Subjunctive # The subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire , a demand , an emotion , uncertainty , or doubt . # #Present subjunctive# # Normally , a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time . * Yo soy muy ambicioso ( I am very ambitious ) * Marta trae la comida ( Marta brings the food ) If the sentence is trying to express a desire , demand , or emotion , or something similar , in the present tense , the subjunctive is used . * Quiero que seas muy ambicioso ( I want you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ' ' that you be ' ' very ambitious * Me alegro de que Marta traiga la comida ( I am happy that Marta brings the food ) * Es una lstima que llegues tarde ( It is a shame that you arrive late ) The subjunctive is also used to convey doubt , denial , or uncertainty . * Busco un amigo que ' ' sea ' ' simptico ( I search for a friend who will ' ' be ' ' likable or I search for a likable friend ) * No hay ningn autor que lo ' ' escriba ' ' . ( There are no authors who ' ' write ' ' that. ) * Es posible que ella ' ' sepa ' ' mucho ( It is possible that she ' ' knows ' ' a lot. ) * No parece que ' ' tengan ' ' mucho dinero ( It does not seem that they ' ' have ' ' much money . ) In the first two examples , the ideally likable friend has not yet been found and remains an uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . In the third , possibility is not certainty , but rather a conjecture , and the last expresses clear doubt . Thus , subjunctive is used . Some of the phrases and verbs that require sentences to have subjunctive formation include : *Dudar , negar , esperar , alegrarse de , temer , sentir , pedir , aconsejar , exigir , desear , querer , mandar *Es necesario que , conviene que , no parece que , es dudoso que , es probable que , no creo que , importa que , parece mentira que Some phrases that require the indicative instead , because they express certainty , include : *Es verdad que , es obvio que , es seguro que , parece que , es evidente que , creo que To form the subjunctive , first take the present indicative first-person ( ' yo ' ) form of a verb . For example , the verbs hablar , comer , and escribir ( To talk , to eat , to write ) -- Yo hablo , yo como , yo escribo Then , replace the ending ' o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the following : If the verb is an -er or -ir verb such as comer , poder , escribir , or compartir , replace the ending o with an ' a ' i.e. : Yo como ; yo puedo ; yo escribo -- Yo coma ; yo pueda ; yo escriba If the verb is an -ar verb such as caminar , or hablar , replace the ending o with an ' e ' i.e. : Yo hablo ; yo camino -- Yo hable , yo camine This forms the first-person conjugation . The others are as follows : * Yo - Yo hable ; yo coma ; yo escriba * T - T hables ; t comas ; t escribas * l/Ella/Usted - l hable ; l coma ; l escriba * Nosotros - Nosotros hablemos ; nosotros comamos ; nosotros escribamos * Vosotros - Vosotros hablis ; vosotros comis ; vosotros escribis * Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes - ellos hablen ; ellos coman ; ellos escriban Since the ' ' vos ' ' forms are derived from ' ' vosotros ' ' the following would be expected ( and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vos coms ; vos escribs However , the Spanish Royal Academy , based in Argentinian usage recommends to use the same forms used for ' ' t ' ' : * Vos - Vos hables ; vos comas ; vos escribas # #Imperfect subjunctive# # Today , the two forms of the imperfect subjunctive are largely interchangeable. * The -se form derives ( as in most Romance languages ) from the Latin pluperfect subjunctive , while the -ra form derives from the Latin pluperfect indicative . The use of one or the other is largely a matter of personal taste and dialect . Many only use the ' ' -ra ' ' forms in speech , but vary between the two in writing . Many may spontaneously use either , or even prefer the rarer ' ' -se ' ' forms . The imperfect subjunctive is formed for basically the same reasons as the present subjunctive , but is used for other tenses and time frames . # Nouns # Spanish has nouns of two genders , masculine and feminine . # Adjectives # Spanish generally uses adjectives in a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are three key differences between English and Spanish adjectives. * In Spanish , adjectives usually go ' ' after ' ' the noun they modify . The exception is when the writer/speaker is being slightly emphatic , or even poetic , about a particular quality of an object ( rather than the mundane use of using the quality to specify which particular object they are referring to ) . ** ' ' Mi casa roja ' ' could either mean that there are many red houses in the world but I wish to talk about the one that I happen to own , or that I have many houses but am referring to the red one . ' ' Mi casa roja ' ' = My house , the red one . ** ' ' Mi roja casa ' ' means that I am stressing how red my particular house is ( probably the only house I have ) . ' ' Mi roja casa ' ' = My house , which is obviously red . * In Spanish , adjectives agree with what they refer to in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . For example , ' ' taza ' ' ( cup ) is feminine , so the red cup is ' ' la taza roj  a  ' ' , but ' ' vaso ' ' ( glass ) is masculine , so the red glass is ' ' el vaso roj  o  ' ' . * In Spanish , it is perfectly normal to let an adjective stand in for a noun or pronounwith ( where people are involved ) no implication of condescension or rudeness . For example , ' ' los altos ' ' means the tall ones or the tall men . ' ' El grande ' ' means the big one or the big man . # Determiners # Spanish uses determiners in a similar way to English . The main difference is that they agree with what they refer to in terms of both number ( singular/plural ) and gender ( masculine/feminine ) . # Articles # Definite articles : equivalent to the . Indefinite articles : equivalent to a/an , some . cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 ! ROWSPAN=2 BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB ARTICLESBGCOLOR= @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SingularBGCOLOR= #DBDBDB PluralBGCOLOR= #DBDBDB SingularBGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Plural ! BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Masculineellosununos ! BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Femininelalasunaunas ! BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Neuterlo The neuter article ' ' lo ' ' is used before a masculine singular adjective to form an expression equivalent to an abstract noun , e.g. ' ' lo interesante ' ' ' the interesting thing , the interesting part ' ( , 7.2.1 ; , 64 ) . ' ' Lo ' ' may also be used adverbially before an adjective that shows agreement with a noun , being equivalent to the relative adverb ' how ' , as in ' ' lo buenas que son ' ' ' how good they ( f.pl. ) are ' ( , 7.2.2 ; , 69 ) . When the article ' ' el ' ' follows either of the prepositions ' ' a ' ' or ' ' de ' ' , the sequence of two words forms a contraction , ' ' al ' ' ( ' to the ' ) or ' ' del ' ' ( ' of the , from the ' ) respectively . Examples : ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the park ' ) . ' ' l regresa del cine ' ' ( ' He returns from the movie theater ' ) . One never says ' ' a el ' ' or ' ' de el ' ' in Spanish . The feminine singular definite article ' ' la ' ' is replaced by ' ' el ' ' when directly before a noun that begins with a stressed a sound ( with or without silent ' ' h ' ' ) . Thus ' ' el agua ' ' , ' ' el hambre ' ' . The noun remains feminine , as shown by ' ' el agua fra ' ' . Likewise , the feminine indefinite article ' ' una ' ' is usually replaced by ' ' un ' ' in the same circumstances , thus ' ' un guila mexicana ' ' . When these words are in plural , the feminine articles are used . ' ' Example : ' ' el agua , las aguas. # Demonstratives # Spanish has three kinds of demonstrative , whose use depends on the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equates to the English terms this and that , although in Spanish the word used must agree for number and gender . cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 !

BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Neuter singularestoesoaquello NOTE : When standing before the noun they qualify i.e. , when used as adjectives demonstratives never take an accent : esta casa ' ' ( this house ) ' ' , esos das ' ' ( those days ) ' ' . But demonstratives may also stand on their own , instead of the noun they refer to i.e. as demonstrative pronouns . In that case , they usually carry a written accent : Quiero ste ' ' ( I want this one ) ' ' . Neuter demonstratives have the meaning of this ( or that ) thing , concept or idea : Eso est bien ' ' ( That is okay ) ' ' . In certain cases , neuter demonstratives can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( Take that out of there ) ' ' . Neuter demonstratives , because of their use , are never used as adjectives , which makes it unnecessary for them ever to take an accent . Moreover , for their indefinite meaning they do not have plural forms . # Possessive # The possessive words agree in gender and number with the thing possessed . The possessive pronoun is formed by putting the agreeing definite article before the long form of the possessive adjective . Each cell in the table below shows the indicated adjective , followed by the corresponding pronoun . When the possessor is ' ' usted ' ' or ' ' ustedes ' ' , the third-person ( possessor ) form is used . cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 ! BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB POSSESSIVES !

Therefore , if a man has a house ( Spanish casa , which is a feminine noun ) we can say that La casa es suya ( The house is his ) , with a feminine possessive , according to the gender of the object this man possesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , perro , a masculine noun ) , then we can say that El perro es suyo ( The dog is hers ) , with a masculine possessive to agree with the noun perro . # Other determiners # * Indefinite quantity : ' ' poco ' ' ( ' little ' ) , ' ' mucho ' ' ( ' a lot ' ) , ' ' bastante ' ' ( ' enough ' ) ... * Cardinals : ' ' un ' ' / ' ' una ' ' ( ' one ' ) , ' ' dos ' ' ( ' two ' ) , ' ' tres ' ' ( ' three ' ) ... * Ordinals : ' ' primero ' ' ( ' first ' ) , ' ' segundo ' ' ( ' second ' ) , ' ' tercero ' ' ( ' third ' ) ... Cardinal and ordinal numbers are adjectives of amount ( like ' ' mucho ' ' and ' ' poco ' ' ) and precede nouns ( ' ' dos animales ' ' = ' two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' first person ' ) . ' ' Primero ' ' and ' ' tercero ' ' drop their final ' ' -o ' ' before a masculine singular noun , thus ' ' el primer libro ' ' ( ' the first book ' ) , ' ' el tercer ao ' ' ( ' the third year ' ) . * Interrogative : ' ' qu ' ' ( ' what ' ) , ' ' cul ' ' ( ' which ' ) . The cardinal numbers greater than ' ' un ' ' / ' ' una ' ' and the interrogative ' ' qu ' ' are indeclinable . The indefinite quantifiers , ordinals , ' ' un ' ' , and ' ' cul ' ' are declined as adjectives. # Pronouns # Spanish has a range of pronouns that in some ways work quite differently from English ones . They include : ' ' yo , t , vos , usted , l , ella , ello , nosotros , vosotros , ustedes , ellos , ellas , esto , eso , aquello ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , but it is not rare to see one in written text or in the spoken language , whether it be for emphasis or in cases where there may be some confusion between conjugations. # Prepositions # Spanish has a relatively large number of prepositions , and does not use postpositions . The following list is traditionally recited : ' ' A , ante , bajo , cabe , con , contra , de , desde , en , entre , hacia , hasta , para , por , segn , sin , so , sobre , tras . ' ' Lately , two new prepositions have been added : durante and mediante , usually placed at the end to preserve the list ( which is usually learnt by heart by Spanish students ) . This list includes two archaic prepositions ( ' ' so ' ' and ' ' cabe ' ' ) , but leaves out two new Latinisms ( ' ' va ' ' and ' ' pro ' ' ) as well as a large number of very important compound prepositions . Prepositions in Spanish do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . For example , to translate run out of water run up a bill run down a pedestrian run in a thief into Spanish requires completely different verbs , and not simply the use of correr ( run ) plus the corresponding Spanish prepositions . This is more due to the nature of English phrasal verbs rather than an inherent function of Spanish verbs or prepositions . # Conjunctions # The Spanish conjunctions ' ' y ' ' ( ' and ' ) and ' ' o ' ' ( ' or ' ) alter their form in both spoken and written language to ' ' e ' ' and ' ' u ' ' respectively when followed by an identical vowel sound . Thus , ' ' padre e hijo ' ' ( ' father and son ' ) , ' ' Fernando e Isabel ' ' ( ' Ferdinand and Isabella ' ) , ' ' sujeto u objeto ' ' ( ' subject or object ' ) , ' ' vertical u horizontal ' ' ( ' vertical or horizontal ' ) . The change does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' of a diphthong , as in ' ' acero y hierro ' ' ( ' steel and iron ' ) . Nor does the conjunction ' ' y ' ' change when initial in a question ( where it serves to introduce or reintroduce a name as a topic , rather than to link one element with another ) , as in ' ' Y Ins ? ' ' ( ' What about Ins ? ' ) . When the conjunction ' ' o ' ' appears between numerals , it is usually spelled with an accent mark ( ' ' ' ' ) , in order to distinguish it from zero ( ' ' 0 ' ' ) ; thus , ' ' 2 3 ' ' ( ' 2 or 3 ' ) in contrast to ' ' 203 ' ' ( ' two-hundred three ' ) . # Syntactic variation # # Cleft sentences # A cleft sentence is one formed with the copular verb ( generally with a dummy pronoun like it as its subject ) , plus a word that cleaves the sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put emphasis on a part of the sentence . Here are some examples of English sentences and their cleft versions : * I did it . It was I who did it . or colloquially It was me that did it . * You will stop smoking through willpower . It is through willpower that you will stop smoking . Spanish does not usually employ such a structure in simple sentences . The translations of sentences like these can be readily analyzed as being normal sentences containing relative pronouns . Spanish is capable of expressing such concepts without a special cleft structure thanks to its flexible word order . For example , if we translate a cleft sentence such as It was Juan who lost the keys , we get ' ' Fue Juan el que perdi las llaves . ' ' Whereas the English sentence uses a special structure , the Spanish one does not . The verb ' ' fue ' ' has no dummy subject , and the pronoun ' ' el que ' ' is not a cleaver but a nominalising relative pronoun meaning the male one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and las llaves , we can play with the word order of the Spanish sentence without affecting its structure although each permutation would , to a native speaker , give a subtly different shading of emphasis . For example , we can say ' ' Juan fue el que perdi las llaves ' ' ( Juan was the one who lost the keys ) or ' ' El que perdi las llaves fue Juan ' ' ( The one who lost the keys was Juan ) . As can be seen from the translations , if this word order is chosen , English stops using the cleft structure ( there is no more dummy it and a nominalising relative is used instead of the cleaving word ) whilst in Spanish no words have changed . Here are some examples of such sentences : * ' ' Fue Juan  el que  perdi las llaves. ' ' = It was John who lost the keys . * ' ' Son slo tres das  los que  te quedan. ' ' = It is only three days that you have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo diga. ' ' = It will be I who tells him . * ' ' Son pocos  los que  vienen y se quedan. ' ' = lit . It is not many who come and stay . Note that it is ungrammatical to try to use just ' ' que ' ' to cleave such sentences as in English , but using ' ' quien ' ' in singular or ' ' quienes ' ' in plural is grammatical . * ' ' *Fue Juan  que  perdi las llaves. ' ' ( incorrect ) * ' ' Fue Juan  quien  perdi las llaves. ' ' ( correct ) When prepositions come into play , things become complicated . Structures unambiguously identifiable as cleft sentences are used . The verb ' ' ser ' ' introduces the stressed element and then there is a nominaliser . Both of these are preceded by the relevant preposition . For example : * ' ' Fue  a m a quien  le dio permiso. ' ' = It was me to whom he gave permission , lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * ' ' Es  para nosotros para quienes  se hizo esto . ' ' = It is us for whom this was made , lit . It is for us for whom this was made * ' ' Es  por eso por lo que  lo hice. ' ' = That is why I did it , more literally : It is because of that that I did it , or completely literally : It is because of that because of which I did it . * ' ' Es as  como  se debe hacer ' ' = It is this way that it must be done , lit . It is this way how it must be done ( ' ' como ' ' replaces longer expressions such as ' ' la forma en que ' ' ) This structure is quite wordy , and is therefore often avoided by not using a cleft sentence at all . Emphasis is conveyed just by word order and stressing with the voice ( indicated here within bolding ) : * ' ' Me dio permiso  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me * ' ' Se hizo esto  para nosotros  . ' ' = This was done for us * ' '  Por eso  lo hice. ' ' = I did it because of that * ' ' Se debe hacer  as  ' ' = It must be done this way In casual speech , the complex cleaving pronoun is often reduced to ' ' que ' ' , just as it is reduced to that in English . Foreign learners are advised to avoid this . * ' ' Es para nosotros  que  se hizo esto . ' ' * ' ' Es por eso  que  lo hice. ' ' * ' ' Fue a m  que  le dio permiso. ' ' ( preferred : ' ' a quien ' ' ) * ' ' Es as  que  se debe hacer ' ' ( preferred : ' ' como ' ' ) In the singular , the subordinate clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with the subject of the main sentence , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plural , only agreement with the subject of the main sentence is acceptable . Therefore : ; Singular * ' ' Yo fui el que  me lo beb  ' ' = I was the one who drank it ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) * ' ' Yo fui el que  se lo bebi  ' ' ( preferred form with same meaning , agreement with ' ' el que ' ' ) * ' ' La que lo  s  soy yo ' ' = I am the one who knows ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) * ' ' La que lo  sabe  soy yo ' ' = ( preferred form with same meaning , agreement with ' ' la que ' ' ) ; Plural * ' ' Somos los nicos que no  tenemos  ni un centavo para apostar ' ' = We are the only ones who do not have even a cent to bet ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) ( from dialogue of the Gabriel Garca Mrquez novel ' ' El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ' ' Vosotras sois las que lo  sabis  ' ' = You girls are the ones who know ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) # Dialectal variations # # Forms of address # The use of ' ' usted ' ' and ' ' ustedes ' ' as a polite form of address is universal . However , there are variations in informal address . ' ' Ustedes ' ' replaces ' ' vosotros ' ' in much of Andalusia , the Canary Islands and Latin America , except in the liturgical or poetic of styles . In some parts of Andalusia , the pronoun ' ' ustedes ' ' is used with the standard ' ' vosotros ' ' endings . Depending on the region , Latin Americans may also replace the singular ' ' t ' ' with ' ' usted ' ' or ' ' vos ' ' . The choice of pronoun is a tricky issue and can even vary from village to village . Travellers are often advised to play it safe and call everyone ' ' usted ' ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas where syllable-final /s/ is completely silent is that there is no audible difference between the second and third person singular form of the verb . This leads to redundant pronoun use , for example , the tagging on of ' ' t ves ? ' ' ( pronounced ' ' tuv ' ' ) to the ends of sentences , where other speakers would say ' ' ves ? ' ' . # # ' ' Voseo ' ' # # ' ' Vos ' ' was used in medieval Castilian as a polite form , like the French ' ' vous ' ' and the Italian ' ' voi ' ' , and it used the same forms as ' ' vosotros ' ' . This gave three levels of formality : * ' ' T quieres ' ' * ' ' Vos queris ' ' ( originally ' ' queredes ' ' ) * ' ' Vuestra merced quiere ' ' ( today ' ' usted ' ' ) Whereas ' ' vos ' ' was lost in standard Spanish , some dialects lost ' ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as the informal pronoun . The exact connotations of this practice , called ' ' voseo ' ' , depend on the dialect . In certain countries there may be socioeconomic implications . El ' ' voseo ' ' uses the pronoun ' ' vos ' ' for ' ' t ' ' , but maintains ' ' te ' ' as an object pronoun and ' ' tu ' ' and ' ' tuyo ' ' as possessives . In ' ' voseo ' ' , verbs corresponding to ' ' vos ' ' in the present indicative ( roughly equivalent to the English simple present ) , are formed from the second person plural ( the form for ' ' vosotros ' ' ) . If the second person plural ends in is or is , the form for ' ' vos ' ' drops the i : * Vosotros hablis - vos habls. * Vosotros tenis - vos tens . Similarly the verb ser ( to be ) has : * Vosotros sois - vos sos . If the second person plural ends in -s ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' vos ' ' is identical : * Vosotros vivs - vos vivs. * Vosotros os - vos os. * Vosotros hus - vos hus . In the imperative , the form for ' ' vos ' ' is also derived from the second person plural . The latter ends always in -d . So for the form for ' ' vos ' ' this d is removed , and if the verb has more than one syllable , an accent is added to the last vowel : * Tened ( vosotros ) - ten ( vos ) * Dad ( vosotros ) - da ( vos ) . The only exception to these rules is in the verb ir ( to go ) , which does not have an imperative form for vos and uses the analogous form of the verb andar , which has a similar meaning , and is regular : * Andad - and . In the present subjunctive , the same rules as for the present indicative apply , though these forms coexist in Argentina with those for the pronoun t : * Que vosotros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digas - que vos digas . Other tenses always have the same form for vos as for t . Outside Argentina , other combinations are possible . For instance , people in Maracaibo may use standard ' ' vosotros ' ' endings for ' ' vos ' ' ' ' ( vos hablis , que vos hablis ) ' ' . # # ' ' Vosotros ' ' imperative : ' ' -ar ' ' for ' ' -ad ' ' # # In Spain , colloquially , the infinitive is used instead of the normative imperative for ' ' vosotros ' ' . This is not accepted in the normative language . * ' ' Venir ! ' ' instead of ' ' Venid ! ' ' * ' ' Callaros ! ' ' instead of ' ' Callaos ! ' ' ( ' ' Callarse ! ' ' in some dialects ) * ' ' Iros ! ' ' or ' ' Marcharos ! ' ' instead of ' ' Idos ! ' ' # # non-normative ' ' -s ' ' on ' ' t ' ' form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normatively has an ' ' -s ' ' ending in the second person singular of the preterite or simple past . For example , ' ' lo hicistes ' ' instead of the normative ' ' lo hiciste ' ' ; ' ' hablastes t ' ' for ' ' hablaste t ' ' . This is the only instance in which the ' ' t ' ' form does not end in an ' ' -s ' ' in the normative language . Ladino has gone further with ' ' hablates ' ' . # Third-person object pronoun variation # The third-person direct- and indirect-object pronouns exhibit variation from region to region , from one individual to another , and even within the language of single individuals . The Real Academia Espaola prefers an etymological usage , namely one in which the indirect object function is carried by ' ' le ' ' ( regardless of gender ) , and the direct object function is carried by ' ' la ' ' or ' ' lo ' ' ( according to the gender of the antecedent , and regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' ' le ' ' as a direct object form for masculine , animate antecedents ( i.e. male humans ) . Deviations from these approved usages are named ' ' lesmo ' ' ( for the use of ' ' le ' ' as a direct object ) , and ' ' lasmo ' ' and ' ' losmo ' ' ( for the use of ' ' la ' ' and ' ' lo ' ' as indirect objects ) . Each of these usages is further described in its own Wikipedia article . This object pronoun variation is studied in detail by . # ' ' Quesmo ' ' and ' ' dequesmo ' ' # Noun clauses in Spanish are typically introduced by the complementizer ' ' que ' ' , and such a noun clause may serve as the object of the preposition ' ' de ' ' , resulting in the sequence ' ' de que ' ' in the standard language . This sequence , in turn , is often reduced colloquially to just ' ' que ' ' , and this reduction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of hypercorrection ( i.e. in an apparent effort to avoid the error of ' ' quesmo ' ' ) , insert ' ' de ' ' before ' ' que ' ' in contexts where it is not prescribed in the standard grammar . This insertion of extraneous ' ' de ' ' before ' ' que ' ' called ' ' dequesmo ' ' is generally associated with less-educated speakers .
