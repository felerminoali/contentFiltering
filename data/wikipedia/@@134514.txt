Speculation has led to a romantic Indian myth ; to the mistaken belief that it was 96 miles to the nearest Cherokee settlement of Keowee ; to a counting of creeks crossing the main road leading from Lexington , SC , to Ninety-Six , SC ; to an interpretation of a Welsh expression , nant-sych , meaning dry gulch . However , no one is able to confirm that Robert Goudey was Welsh , English , Scottish , or German . An examination of early maps indicates markings such as 30 and 60 and 90 at different points , possibly indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible that Parish linear measurements used in England were used on colonial maps to measure distances in chains . In England , according to a British and Welsh booklet designating linear measurements , Parish maps used a rule of 4 chains to the inch . In using that parish rule on an early map of colonial South Carolina , 90 chains on a map would probably cover approximately 24 inches , the map distance from Saxe Gotha ( modern Lexington , SC ) to Ninety-Six . Using the same measurements for the distance from Ninety-Six to the Savannah River , the measurement would be approximately 2.5 inches or 6 chains , hence 96 . Even so , the origin of the name , Ninety-Six , likely remains a mystery . # History # Ninety Six was established on the frontier in the early 18th century ; it was known for a time as Jews Land because some prominent Sephardic Jewish families of London bought extensive property there .
