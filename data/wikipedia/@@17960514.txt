A drum stick is a type of percussion mallet used particularly for playing snare drum , drum kit and some other percussion instruments , and particularly for playing unpitched percussion . Specialized beaters used on some other percussion instruments , such as the metal beater or ' ' wand ' ' used with a triangle , and particularly beaters or ' ' mallets ' ' used with tuned percussion such as xylophone and timpani , are not normally referred to as ' ' drum sticks ' ' . Drum sticks generally have all of the following characteristics : * they normally come in a set of 8 for the kit . * They are held in the hands , most often one in each hand . * They may be used to play at least some sort of drum ( as well as other instruments ) . * They are normally used only for untuned percussion . # Construction # The archetypical drum stick is turned from a single piece of wood , most commonly of hickory , less commonly of maple , and least commonly but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional form are also made from metal , carbon fibre and other modern materials . The tip or bead is the part most often used to strike the instrument . Originally and still commonly of the same piece of wood as the rest of the stick , sticks with nylon tips have also been available since 1958 , originally conceived by Jonathan Pumphrey and Joe Calato in Niagara Falls , NY . In the 1970s , an acetal tip was introduced , designed by Ken Drinan and Paul Kiersted . Tips of whatever material are of various shapes , including acorn , barrel , oval and round . The shoulder of the stick is the part that tapers towards the tip , and is normally slightly convex . It is often used for playing the bell of a cymbal . It can also be used to produce a cymbal crash when applied with a glancing motion to the bow or rim of a cymbal , and for playing ride patterns on china , swish and pang cymbals . The shaft is the body of the stick , and is cylindrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is used for playing cross stick and applied in a glancing motion to the rim of a cymbal for the loudest cymbal crashes . The butt is the opposite end of the stick to the tip . Some rock musicians use it rather than the tip . # Conventional numbering # Plain wooden drum sticks are most commonly described using a number to describe the weight and diameter of the stick followed by one or more letters to describe the tip . For example , a 7A is a common jazz stick with a wooden tip , while a 7N is the same weight of stick with a nylon tip , and a 7B is a wooden tip but with a different tip profile , shorter and rounder than a 7A . A 5A is a common wood tipped rock stick , heavier than a 7A but with a similar profile . The numbers are most commonly odd but even numbers are used occasionally , in the range 2 ( heaviest ) to 9 ( lightest ) . The exact meanings of both numbers and letters differ from manufacturer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system at all , just being known as ' ' Jazz ' ' ( typically a 7N or 8N ) or ' ' Heavy Rock ' ' ( typically a 4B or 5B ) for example . The most general purpose stick is a 5A ( wood tip , for snare tone ) or 5AN ( nylon tip , for cymbal tone ) . # Techniques # # Grip # There are two main ways of holding drumsticks : * Traditional grip , in which right and left hands use different grips . * Matched grip , in which the two hand grips are mirror-image . Traditional grip was developed to conveniently play a snare drum while marching , and was documented and popularised by Sanford A. Moeller in ' ' The Art of Snare Drumming ' ' ( 1925 ) . It was the standard grip for kit drummers in the first half of the twentieth century and remains popular , and the standard grip for most snare drummers . Matched grips are normal for most other instruments , and became popular for kit drumming towards the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit drumming . However the traditional grip has since made a comeback , and both types of grip are still used and promoted by leading kit drummers and teachers . # Popular brands # *Vic Firth *Pro-Mark *Vater *Zildjian *Regal Tip *Tama Drums
