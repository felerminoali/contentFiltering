Launched in 1848 , she served three commissions , firstly on the West Indies and North American Station , then on the West Africa Station and finally in the Pacific Station . It was during her last commission as a survey ship that she left her most enduring legacy ; in charting the west coast of British Columbia she left her name and those of her ship 's company scattered across the charts of the region .
