Apollodotus II ( Greek : ) , was an Indo-Greek king who ruled in the western and eastern parts of Punjab . Bopearachchi dates him to circa 8065 BCE , and R. C. Senior to circa 8565 BCE . Apollodotos II was an important ruler who seems to have re-established the Indo-Greek kingdom to some extent of its former glory . Taxila in western Punjab was reconquered from nomad Scythian rule , and according to Bopearachchi , eastern territory was taken back from Indian kingdoms . # Rule # Apollodotus II seems to have been a member of the dynasty of Menander I , since he used their typical deity Athena Alkidemos on most of his silver , and also Menander 's title ' ' Soter ' ' ( Greek : , the Saviour ) , on all his coins . On some coins , he also calls himself ' ' Philopator ' ' ( Greek : , the father-loving ) , which proves that his father had been king before him . R C Senior guesses that Amyntas or Epander could have been his father . Apollodotus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scythian king Maues ruled in Gandhara and its capital Taxila . What probably happened is that Apollodotus II took over Taxila after the death of Maues , though it is uncertain whether he defeated Maues or his descendants , or was allied or related to the dynasty of Maues . The late Indo-Greeks may have been rather mixed with both Indians and Scythians . R C Senior suggests that Apollodotus had struck an alliance with another Scythian king , Azes I. The Scythian hold of Gandhara loosened after the death of Maues , and petty kings of mixed or uncertain origin , like Artemidorus the son of Maues , Telephus and perhaps Menander II emerged in the area . These kings posed no threat to Apollodotus II , who on some of his coins assumed the title ' ' Basileus Megas ' ' ( Greek : , Great King ) , in echo of Maues ' boastful title Great King of Kings . After the death of Apollodotus II , the Indo-Greek kingdom fragmented once more . # Coins of Apollodotus II # Obv . : Greek legend reads , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kharoshthi script Tratarasa Maharajasa Apalatasa Saviour King Appolodotus , with goddess Athena ( type of Menander I ) . Apollodotus II issued a large number of coins . He struck silver a with diademed portrait on the obverse and a reverse of Athena Alkidemos , and also a unique coin with the reverse of a king , possibly Alexander the Great , sitting on a horned horse similar to Alexander 's Bucephalus and holding his hand in a benediction gesture . He struck bronzes with Apollo/tripod , a type introduced by his namesake Apollodotus I. The coins of Apollodotus II are of different qualities . Some still have the realistic portraits characteristic of the earlier Indo-Greek coins , and Bopearachchi attributes these series to the western part of his kingdom . Others are badly struck and/or have clumsy and distorted portraits , and these Bopearachchi interprets as belonging to newly opened mints in eastern Punjab , presumably struck by Indian celators with little knowledge of Greek engraving skills . On some of his coins there are both extra monograms in shape of Kharosthi letters . These monograms are interpreted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to officials with Indian names . The coins therefore indicate that Apollodotus II relied more on his Indian subjects than earlier kings , and also opened new mints in eastern Punjab where Greek presence was scarce . # Overstrikes # Apollodotus II overstruck a bronze of Maues . Zoilos II overstruck some of the coins of Apollodotus II , as did Azes I. **14;7143;br align= center cellpadding= 2 border= 2
