birthplace = Buffalo , New York deathplace = Suffolk , New York Peter Grippe ( August 11 , 1912 October 18 , 2002 ) was an American sculptor , printmaker , and painter . As a sculptor , he worked in bronze , terracotta , wire , plaster , and found objects . His Monument to Hiroshima series ( 1963 ) used found objects cast in bronze sculptures to evoke the chaotic humanity of the Japanese city after its incineration by atomic bomb . Other Grippe Surrealist sculptural works address less warlike themes , including that of city life . However , his expertise extended beyond sculpture to ink drawings , watercolor painting , and printmaking ( intaglio ) . He joined and later directed Atelier 17 , the intaglio studio founded in London and moved to New York at the beginning of World War II by its founder , Stanley William Hayter .

While primarily known as a sculptor working in bronze and clay , he created a portfolio of etchings by 21 artists ( examples include Willem de Kooning , Jacques Lipchitz , and Peter Grippe himself ) and 21 poets ( including Frank O'Hara , Dylan Thomas , and Thomas Merton ) in a work entitled ' ' 21 Etchings and Poems ' ' . The collective work took three years to print and was published by New York 's Morris Gallery in 1960 . Grippe was educated at the Albright-Knox Art School ( today the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy ) and the Art Institute of Buffalo . He moved to New York in the 1930s , and his work reflects a move into the Cubist and Surrealist schools . According to Bob Mattison , Marshall R. Metzgar Professor of Art History at Lafayette College , Easton , Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grippe and his colleagues embraced Cubism with its openwork multidimensional view of the world and Surrealist imagery drawn from the subconscious thus bringing American sculpture into the modern era . As Grippe 's artistic and academic career progressed , he taught at several higher education institutions , including Brandeis University , where he was named the first professor of sculpture . He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the category of fine arts in 1964 . A transcribed interview with Grippe is available at the Smithsonian Institution 's Archives of American Art . The interviewer , Dorothy Seckler , spoke with him in 1968 . Grippe is also mentioned in a transcribed Smithsonian Institution interview in 2002 with Ruth Asawa in her San Francisco in which she discusses his technique and their associates during the period from 1946 to 1949 .
