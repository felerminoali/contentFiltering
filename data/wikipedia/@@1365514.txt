date = October 30 , 1838 The Haun 's Mill massacre was an event in the history of the Latter Day Saint movement . It occurred on October 30 , 1838 when a mob/militia unit from Livingston County , Missouri , attacked a Mormon settlement in eastern Caldwell County , Missouri , United States , after the Battle of Crooked River . By far the bloodiest event in the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri , it has long been remembered by the members of the Latter Day Saint movement . The fifty-five attackers known by name to be involved were never prosecuted . # Haun 's Mill # Haun 's Mill was a mill established on the banks of Shoal Creek in Fairview Township , Caldwell County , Missouri in 18351836 by Jacob Haun ( Hawn ) , who was not a Mormon . However , by October 1838 there were approximately 75 Mormon families living along the banks of Shoal Creek , about 30 of them in the immediate vicinity of Haun 's Mill and the blacksmith shop . # Missouri militia # The militia involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Livingston County . At the time of the attack it consisted of 240 men from Daviess , Livingston , Ray , Carroll , and Chariton counties and included prominent men such as Charles Ashby of the Missouri state legislature and Thomas O. Byron , Clerk of Livingston County . Although the massacre took place a few days after Missouri 's governor , Lilburn Boggs , issued his infamous Extermination Order , most historians have now concluded that the militia unit had neither the time nor the opportunity to have received news of the order . # Truce # The threat posed by the growing strength and animosity of the Missouri militia caused considerable concern among the Mormon settlers at Haun 's Mill . They held a council on Sunday , October 28 , and decided to organize a defensive force . 28 men were armed and held in readiness against an attack . That same evening , one of the militia groups sent a representative who negotiated a truce with the settlers . Monday the 29th and most of Tuesday the 30th passed without incident . # Massacre # On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the community . David Evans , a leader in the community , ran towards the militia , waving his hat and calling for peace . Alerted to the militia 's approach , most of the Latter-day Saint women and children fled into the woods to the south , while most of the men headed to the blacksmith shop . Unfortunately , the building was a particularly vulnerable structure as the widely spaced logs made it easy for the attackers to fire inside . The shop became a deathtrap , since the militia gave no quarter , firing about one hundred rifle and musket shots into the building . After the initial attack , several of those who had been wounded or had surrendered were shot dead . Members of the militia entered the shop and found ten-year-old Sardius Smith , eight-year old Alma Smith , and nine-year-old Charles Merrick hiding under the blacksmith 's bellows . Alma and Charles were shot ( Charles later died ) , and William Reynolds put his musket against Sardius 's skull and blew off the top of his head , killing him .

Seventy-eight-year-old Thomas McBride surrendered his musket to militiaman Jacob Rogers , who then shot McBride and hacked his body apart with a corn knife . Several other bodies were mutilated or clothing stolen , while many women were assaulted . Houses were robbed , wagons , tents and clothing were stolen , and horses and livestock were driven off , leaving the surviving women and children destitute . By the end of the massacre at least seventeen Mormons were dead : Hiram Abbott , Elias Benner , John Byers , Alexander Campbell , Simon Cox , Josiah Fuller , Austin Hammer , John Lee , Benjamin Lewis , Thomas McBride ( 78 ) , Charley Merrick ( 9 ) , Levi Merrick , William Napier , George S. Richards , Sardius Smith ( 10 ) , Warren Smith ( 44 ) , and John York . Thirteen more had been injured , including a woman and nine-year-old child . A non-Mormon sympathizer was also killed . Three of the 250 militiamen were wounded , but none fatally . After the massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with dirt and straw .

Of the matter , Joseph Smith recorded , Up to this day God had given me wisdom to save the people who took counsel . None had ever been killed who abode by my counsel . Then he recorded that innocent lives could have been saved at Hauns Mill had his counsel been received and followed . It appears that Haun had received the direction to relocate to Far West from Joseph Smith and did not convey this direction to any of the others at Haun 's Mill . Although participants in the massacre boasted of their acts for years , none of the Missouri attackers were ever brought to trial , and the Latter Day Saints ' efforts at receiving justice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacre are maintained as a historic site by the Community of Christ . In May 2012 it was announced that the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had acquired the property from the Community of Christ . The church had also acquired the Far West burying ground from the Community of Christ . This event was dramatized in the Latter-day Saint film ' ' Legacy ' ' .
