( EUROCAT Q33.80 ) ICD9 = ICDO = OMIM = MedlinePlus = eMedicineSubj = ped eMedicineTopic = 534 eMedicinemult = MeshID = D015615 Congenital pulmonary airway malformation ( CPAM ) , formerly known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation ( CCAM ) , is a congenital disorder of the lung similar to bronchopulmonary sequestration . In CPAM , usually an entire lobe of lung is replaced by a non-working cystic piece of abnormal lung tissue . This abnormal tissue will never function as normal lung tissue . The underlying cause for CPAM is unknown . It occurs in approximately 1 in every 30,000 pregnancies . In most cases the outcome of a fetus with CPAM is very good . In rare cases , the cystic mass grows so large as to limit the growth of the surrounding lung and cause pressure against the heart . In these situations , the CPAM can be life-threatening for the fetus . CPAM can be separated into five types , based on clinical and pathologic features . CPAM type 1 is the most common , with large cysts and a good prognosis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor prognosis , owing to its frequent association with other significant anomalies . Other types are rare . # Diagnosis # CPAMs are often identified during routine prenatal ultrasonography . Identifying characteristics on the sonogram include : an echogenic ( bright ) mass appearing in the chest of the fetus , displacement of the heart from its normal position , a flat or everted ( pushed downward ) diaphragm , or the absence of visible lung tissue . CPAMs are classified into three different types based largely on their gross appearance . Type I has a large ( 2 cm ) multiloculated cysts . Type II has smaller uniform cysts . Type III is not grossly cystic , referred to as the adenomatoid type . Microscopically , the lesions are not true cysts , but communicate with the surrounding parenchyma . Some lesions have an abnormal connection to a blood vessel from an aorta and are referred to as hybrid lesions. # Treatment # In most cases , a fetus with CPAM is closely monitored during pregnancy and the CPAM is removed via surgery after birth . Most babies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few months . Many patients have surgery , typically before their first birthday , because of the risk of recurrent lung infections associated with CPAMs . Some pediatric surgeons can safely remove these lesions using very tiny incisions with the aid of a telescope ( thoracoscopy ) . However , some CPAM patients live a full life without any complication or incident . It is hypothesized that there are thousands of people living with an undetected CPAM . Through ultrasound testing employed in recent years , many more patients are aware that they live with this condition . Rarely , long standing CPAMs have been reported to become cancerous . Very large cystic masses might pose a danger during birth because of the airway compression . In this situation , a special surgical type of delivery called the EXIT procedure may be used . In rare extreme cases , where fetus 's heart is in danger , fetal surgery can be performed to remove the CPAM . If non-immune hydrops fetalis develop , there is a near universal mortality of the fetus without intervention . Fetal surgery can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies found that a single course of prenatal steroids ( betamethasone ) may increase survival in hydropic fetuses with microcystic CPAMs to 75-100% . These studies indicate that large microcystic lesions may be treated prenatally without surgical intervention . Large macrocyst lesions may require in utero placement of a Harrison thoracoamniotic shunt . # Popular culture # In season 3 of the television show ' ' House ' ' , episode 17 ( Fetal Position ) features a pregnant woman whose fetus is ultimately diagnosed with CPAM . In the climax of the episode , the team performs open fetal surgery to remove the cysts.
