She batted and threw right handed . After being married she played under the name of Migdalia Jinright . Born in Havana , Mickey Prez was one of the seven players born in Cuba to play the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history , being the others Isabel Alvarez ( 19491954 ) , Isora del Castillo ( 19491951 ) , Luisa Gallegos ( 19481949 ) , Mirtha Marrero ( 19481953 ) , Gloria Ruiz ( 19481949 ) and Zonia Vialat ( 1948 ) . The first AAGPBL spring training outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball . All the eight AAGPBL teams played exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano . On the other hand , the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson , who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues , was training with the Dodgers for the first time . By then , city ordinances in Vero Beach , Florida , where the Dodgers normally trained , prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other . Notably , newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their games than did the Dodgers . At this time , the six Cuban girls were recruited to play in the AAGPBL . That season the league made the transition from underhand to full sidearm pitching . Prez entered the league in 1948 with the Chicago Colleens , playing for them one year before joining the Springfield Sallies ( 19491950 ) , Battle Creek Belles ( 19511952 ) and Rockford Peaches ( 19521954 ) . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastball , a curve , and a change that often had hitters way out in front , but the key was always been in control of her pitches . When the ball-strike count favored her , she was solid and concentrated better . When she was behind , she was vulnerable and created many of her own problems because she had to sacrifice some velocity for control . In addition , she was plagued by a shortage of run support for much of her career while pitching for awful teams . In 1951 , Prez posted a 1316 record and a 3.00 earned run average in 32 pitching appearances for the Belles , while leading the league in complete games ( 26 ) , innings pitched ( 237 ) and hits allowed ( 241 ) . The next season she went 1112 with a 2.34 ERA in a combined action between Battle Creek and Rockford , leading the league in games pitched ( 33 ) and ranking sixth in innings pitched ( 208 ) . Prez had mixed results in the 1953 season , going 1214 for Racine though her 2.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also finished eight in innings pitched ( 220 ) and tied for eight in complete games ( 20 ) . Her career highlight came on August 10 of that year , when she hurled a no-hitter against the powerful Grand Rapids Chicks lineup featuring Wilma Briggs , Betty Foss , Jean Geissinger , Katie Horstman , Pepper Paire and Joanne Weaver , among others . In 1954 , during what turned out to be the final season of the league , Prez went 1111 in 24 games and ended third in innings pitched ( 164 ) , eight in complete games ( 15 ) and tenth in ERA ( 3.73 ) , while tying for sixth in wins . Prez compiled a 5770 record in 155 games , while her 2.73 career ERA ranks her twenty-second in the all-time list of AAGPBL pitchers with at least 1,000 innings of work . She also went 1-3 with a 3.00 ERA in five playoff games ( two years ) . In 1988 , Prez became part of ' ' Women in Baseball ' ' , a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League . Another tribute to the AAGPBL players came with the 1992 film ' ' A League of Their Own ' ' , featuring Tom Hanks , Geena Davis and Madonna , and directed by filmmaker Penny Marshall . In 2011 , she and her AAGPBL teammates from Cuba were honored by having their names and photos presented at a ceremony in New York City . The event was presented by Leslie Heaphy , history professor at Kent State University of Ohio , during the Cuban Baseball Congress held on August 20 at Fordham University . She currently lives in Miami , Florida . # Pitching statistics # border= 2 cellpadding= 5 cellspacing= 0 style= margin : 1em 1em 1em 0 ; background : #F9F9F9 ; border : 1px #aaa solid ; border-collapse : collapse ; font-size:100% ; !
