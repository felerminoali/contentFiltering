The Ashfork Bainbridge Steel Dam , the first large steel dam in the world , and one of only three ever built in the United States , was constructed in 1898 by the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( ATSF ) to supply water for railway operations near Ash Fork , Arizona . It is named for the town of Ash Fork , and for Francis H. Bainbridge , a civil engineer and graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( RPI ) , who was an engineer for ATSF . The dam has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. # Background # The ATSF and other railroads had to make special provisions for water supply in desert conditions , as non condensing steam locomotives consumed a prodigious amount of water . The usual approach was to construct a dam to retain surface water , or to drill a series of wells , and store the water in a water tank . Railroad communities often grew up around these reservoirs or water stops . Ash Fork had been such a town from when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a way point for stagecoach lines previously . Railroads in the U.S. and elsewhere had been leaders in structural development . The masonry arch bridges and viaducts of the early 19th century had given way to bridges made mostly of steel , with considerable economy of material , construction cost , and time , and Bainbridge speculated that similar savings might be possible for dams . This dam was a significant departure from the more typical masonry construction . Already familiar with the construction of the ATSF 's many steel bridges , Bainbridge decided to see whether steel construction could replace masonry in dams as well . The dam 's light weight and prefabricated components must have made assembly easy relative to the laborious job of quarrying and setting stone . Steel dams use relatively thin steel plates in contact with the water surface , with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground . The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow , so that the weight of the water puts compressive forces on the girders holding the plates up . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vertical wall of plates would engender . It was believed that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than masonry dams . # Location # The dam lies about 3 mi to the east of Ash Fork , in Johnson Canyon , and about 15 mi west of Williams , Arizona . It is near the former U.S. Route 66 and Interstate 40 . About a mile upstream lies Stone Dam , a masonry structure constructed 13 years later . The Grand Canyon Railway originates in Williams , branching from the ATSF main that this dam served , and runs northeast to the Grand Canyon . # Construction details # The dam was fabricated by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company and shipped to the site in pieces for erection . Construction of the dam began in 1897 and was completed March 5 , 1898 at a total cost of US$63,519 . The structure gets its scalloped appearance from 24 curved 3/8 inch steel plates ( alternately loose and rigid to compensate for a temperature range from 104F C to minus 4F ) that slope downstream .

It holds about 36000000 USgal of water when full . # History # The dam is an Arizona Historic Civil Engineering Landmark . A professional journal wrote in 1902 that Ash Fork Dam has so many novel features of an experimental character that it is specially interesting and instructive to the engineering profession . In a survey in 1955 , George Lamb said it appears to be in as good condition as if it was just built . It is still in use , unlike the other two steel dams in the United States . The Kaibab National Forest ( part of the United States Forest Service holdings ) is now the owner of the dam , after acquiring it through a land exchange . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 with a structure ID of #76000373. # Notes #  # Further reading # * Jackson , Donald C.
