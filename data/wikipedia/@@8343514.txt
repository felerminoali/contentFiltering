* Kingdom of Poland * Duchy of Pomerania * Kalmar Union * Holy Roman Empire * King of Denmark * King of Norway * King of Sweden * Duke of Pomerania * Duke of Pomerelia * Prince of Rgen The House of Griffins or House of Pomerania ( ; ) , also known as ' ' House of Greifen ' ' ; was a dynasty of dukes ruling the Duchy of Pomerania from the 12th century until 1637 . The name Griffins was used by the dynasty after the 15th century and had been taken from the ducal coat of arms . Wartislaw I ( around 1091 died August 9 , 1135 ) was the first historical ruler of the Duchy of Pomerania and the founder of the Griffin dynasty . The most prominent Griffin was Eric of Pomerania , who became king of the Kalmar Union in 1397 , thus ruling Denmark , Sweden and Norway . Another Griffin , The last Griffin duke of Pomerania was Bogislaw XIV , who died during the Thirty Years ' War , which led to the division of Pomerania between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Duke Bogislaw XIII and the last Griffin died in 1660. # Name of the Dynasty # The dynasty is known by two names , Pomerania , after their primary fief , and Griffin , after their coat of arms , which had depicted a griffin since the late 12th century : The first verifiable use of the griffin as the dynasty 's heraldic emblem occurred in a seal of Casimir II , Duke of Pomerania , which showed the imaginary beast within a shield , and was attached to a document dated 1194 . The name ' ' Pomerania ' ' comes from Slavic ' ' po more ' ' , which means ' ' Land at the Sea ' ' . # Origins and branches # The origins of the Griffins are not clear . Most theories derive them from either local Slavic nobility or a cadet branch of Polish house of Piasts . Medieval Polish chronicler Jan Dugosz connected them with Polish noble family of wiebodzice from the south province of Poland named the Lesser Poland , who also used a griffin as their coat-of-arms . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings from Sorbs mythology called ' ' Gryphus ' ' or ' ' Baltus ' ' . The first known members of the Griffins were the brothers Wartislaw I and Ratibor I. Wartislaw would be the ancestor of the line of dukes that ruled the Duchy of Pomerania until 1630 ; Ratibor would be the ancestor of the Ratiborides branch of the Griffins , that was to rule the lands of Schlawe-Stolp until the line went extinct and the area was incorporated in the Duchy of Pomerania . The first known member of the Swantiborides branch of the Griffins , notable for as castellans of Pomeranian cities , was Wartislaw ( II ) Swantiboriz. # Wartislaw I to Bogislaw IV and Otto I # #Wartislaw I ( between 1134 and 1148 ) @2Bogislaw I ( * about 1130 ; 1187 ) ( I ) Walburgis ( 1177 ) , daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark ; **6;280473;br ( II ) Anastasia , daughter of Mieszko III of Poland and Eudoxia of Kiev @2# ( I ) Ratibor ( * 1160 ; 1183 ) Salome , daughter of Mieszko III of Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
