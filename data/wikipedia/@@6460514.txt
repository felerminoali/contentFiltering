birthplace = Buenos Aires , Argentina deathplace = Buenos Aires , Argentina Mara Luisa Bemberg ( April 14 , 1922 &amp;ndash ; May 7 , 1995 ) was a Buenos Aires-born Argentine feminist , film writer , director and actress , one of the first Latin American women film directors , and a powerful presence in the intellectual Argentina of 1970-1990 . In her work , she specialized in portraying famous South American women and the Argentine upper class . Bemberg also focused on feminism , with regard to the gender debate and cinematic gaze . Bemberg is arguably Latin America 's foremost female director . # Early years # The daughter of Otto Eduardo Bemberg and Sofa Bengolea , she was born into one of the most powerful families in Argentina , as her great-grandfather , German Argentine immigrant Otto Bemberg , had founded the Quilmes Brewery , the country 's largest , in 1888 . Bemberg grew up in a patrician family . Bemberg never received a high school diploma or a college degree . She was privately tutored by a governess . On October 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following their marriage and in the midst of the Juan Pern era , the couple moved to Spain , where they had four children before returning to Argentina . One of them , Carlos Miguens Bemberg , would become a well-known businessman . 10 years later she divorced Miguens . Her partner in subsequent years was film producer Oscar Kramer. # Artistic career # In 1949 , Bemberg became involved with the former Smart Theater and afterwards with the Astral Theater . In 1959 , she established and managed Buenos Aires 's ' ' Teatro Del Globo ' ' with her associate , Catalina Wolff . She was one of the founders of the Mar del Plata Film Festival and the Feminist Union in Argentina . Her original efforts to form feminist groups were muffled by the military regime that superseded Pern in the mid-50s . Bemberg was inspired by French novelist and art theorist Andr Malraux , who visited her aunt 's Villa Ocampo in 1959 , and particularly his belief that one must live what one believes . In 1970 , she wrote the script for Ral de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , a successful film on the Argentine upper class with Graciela Borges and Lautaro Mura , and in 1975 the script for Fernando Ayala 's ' ' Triangle of Four ' ' . After her film ' ' Seora de nadie ' ' was censored by the military regime , she went to New York to study acting from Lee Strasberg . Bemberg used that time to understand how to approach a film from an actor 's perspective . Bemberg decided to pursue directing because she was disappointed with how her semi-autobiographical screenplays were interpreted by male directors . She believed that Argentine men suffered from great insecurity and Latin American films portrayed women poorly , and wanted to change what she felt was an uninteresting image of women in Latin American cinema . She founded her own production company , GEA , with Lita Stantic and directed her first film , ' ' Momentos ' ' , which was self-financed , in 1981 . Among her films , she wrote and directed ' ' Seora de nadie ' ' in 1982 , ' ' Camila ' ' in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lover ordered by Argentine military officer and politician Juan Manuel de Rosas and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ) , ' ' Miss Mary ' ' in 1986 ( featuring British actress Julie Christie ) , and ' ' Yo , la peor de todas ' ' in 1990 ( about the life of Juana Ins de la Cruz , with French actress Dominique Sanda , Argentine actor Hctor Alterio and Spanish actress Assumpta Serna ) . Bemberg 's films were widely popular due to their melodramatic elements , such as with ' ' Camila ' ' , and enjoyed much commercial success . Her last film was 1993 's ' ' De eso no se habla ' ' , starring Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni . At the end of her life , Bemberg was working on a script , based on the story ' ' El impostor ' ' by Silvina Ocampo , a distant relative of hers , which was made into a film in 1997 directed by her longtime collaborator Alejandro Maci . Throughout her career Bemberg worked with longtime producer Lita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London-based stage design firm . Before her death , she bequeathed her personal art collection to the National Museum of Fine Arts . She died of cancer in Buenos Aires on May 7 , 1995 , at age 73. # ' ' Camila ' ' # ' ' Camila ' ' was Bemberg 's first film to gain international recognition . Her longtime producer Lita Stantic brought her a copy of a novel by Enrique Molina based on the life of Argentine socialite Camila O'Gorman . Stantic wanted Bemberg to prove that she could tell a love story . Bemberg was interested in showing Camila as the active pursuer in her relationship and spurning the pillars of family , church and state , freed from what she thought was a role that historians had confined her to . Bemberg was only able to make the film after President Ral Alfonsn outlawed film censorship in 1982 . The film cost US$370,000 to make . # Themes # Scholar Bruce Williams has stated that all of Bemberg 's films show female protagonists transgressing the boundaries and limits of their societies .

With respect to the formal aspects of her films , Bemberg set her own aesthetics , such as the woman 's look , which she considered was lacking in films and especially in Latin American films . In several interviews Bemberg said that she was inspired by New Zealand producer and director Jane Campion and in particular her movie ' ' The Piano ' ' . Eroticism , female sexuality and women were some of Campion 's themes that Bemberg was most interested in . In an interview Bemberg described why Campion 's films were so inspirational for her : In most films , eroticism for the most part is portrayed from a masculine viewpoint . They speak of their sexual prowess , conquests but--excuse me , I 'm going to be very crude--rarely do they mention their inadequacies , problems with erections , impotence . Of that they do n't speak . On the other hand , it 's my impression that if a woman does n't reach marriage as a virgin , well .. But now it seems to me women are beginning to speak out beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : observing events from a different angle . Film scholars have noted that Bemberg 's entire body of work contains autobiographical elements . Not all of Bemberg 's films were focused on historical events and when they did , Bemberg explains in an interview , she intended to situate the viewer in the period . What interests me is the human beings , not the meticulous and obsessive reconstruction of facsimiles of their surroundings . However , in Bemberg 's last film , ' ' De eso no se habla ' ' ( 1994 ) , although it carries her signature , there is a clear change of tone in this story about the love between a foreigner and a dwarf woman . In this film , she abandons the literal account and chooses the metaphor and the satire , within a customary representation masterly recreated . # Filmography # # Awards # Two of her films were featured at the Venice Film Festival .
