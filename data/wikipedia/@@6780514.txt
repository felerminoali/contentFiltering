# History # Venue was the listings magazine for the Bristol and Bath areas of the UK . It was founded in 1982 by journalists who had been working for another Bristol magazine , ' ' Out West ' ' , which had been consciously modelled on London 's Time Out magazine . Originally published fortnightly , ' ' Venue ' ' gained a reputation for the quality and authority of its coverage of the local arts and entertainments scene . It played a leading part in re-establishing Ashton Court Festival and was an early champion of the Bristol Sound in the early 1990s . It continued to play a significant role in nurturing and promoting local art , theatre , film and music until its closure in April 2012 . Venue 's last editor was the playwright Tom Wainwright . ' ' Venue ' ' also had a reputation for investigative reporting of local issues , including health , policing , local politics and environmental matters . ' ' Venue ' ' also featured humour and satire which many found attractive , but which was occasionally criticised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian Mark Watson and comedy scriptwriter Stephen Merchant both worked for ' ' Venue ' ' when they were younger . Author and reviewer Kim Newman contributed regularly . Another author , Eugene Byrne , one of the magazine 's founders , remained involved with it as Consulting Editor until the magazine ceased publication . In 2000 the company was sold to Bristol United Press ( BUP ) , the company which runs the Bristol Evening Post and Western Daily Press newspapers . BUP in turn was owned by the Northcliffe Newspaper Group , part of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust group . The takeover by BUP was controversial with many readers , advertisers and staff , particularly because the political outlook of the Daily Mail is the opposite of the values proclaimed by ' ' Venue ' ' . # Weekly Edition # In 2001 , Venue magazine started to publish weekly , and , trading as Venue Publishing , the company diversified further in the years after this . It produced a successful controlled circulation lifestyle monthly , ' ' Folio ' ' ( whose closure was announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its last published issue ) , as well as several annual guides including Eating Out West , Drinking Out West , Days Out West , a Student Guide for Bristol and Bath and a Festival Guide . Venue Publishing also undertook contract publishing , particularly for large local events such as the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta and the Bristol Harbour Festival . In 2005 , Venue Publishing established an in-house design agency , Bang , offering design services to external clients . The magazine was briefly associated with some other provincial listings magazines in the 1980s like Manchester 's City Life , Southampton 's Due South Magazine and The List which covers Edinburgh and Glasgow . Only the latter is still publishing . # Closure # On February 22 , 2011 , it was announced that ' ' Venue ' ' magazine would be closing and that the last issue would be number 962 , to be sold on March 16 . Ten days later it was announced that , largely as a result of an enthusiastic public campaign to save ' ' Venue ' ' , the magazine would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be a paid-for weekly title - but instead merged with free monthly lifestyle magazine , ' ' Folio ' ' . However , little more than a year later a further restructuring meant the end of the magazine in print . On Friday 13 April 2012 it was announced that the ' ' Venue ' ' title would become online-only with the loss of a number of staff , including publishing director Dave Higgitt . The last ' ' Venue ' ' monthly edition , number 980 , was published in May 2012 . ' ' Folio ' ' magazine continued solo until its last edition , number 219 , was published dated April 2013. # The Weekend ' Powered by Venue ' # The Bristol Evening Post ceased its Saturday edition in April 2012 . A month later on 25 May 2012 , The Post launched a new 64-page lifestyle magazine , given away free with its Friday edition . This magazine carried many of the ' ' Venue ' ' listings , reviews and entertainment articles and was justifiably entitled ' ' The Weekend - Powered by Venue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Weekend ' ' ( 15 March 2013 ) , the ' powered by Venue ' strapline was quietly dropped . The distinctive ' ' Venue ' ' logo continued to be seen in printed format each Wednesday , however , in a section of three or four pages in that day 's Bristol edition of the free Metro ( British newspaper ) , the section being headed WHAT 'S ON The week ahead with ' ' Venue ' ' . The ' ' Venue ' ' name still continued also on periodic publications such as ' ' Venue Festival Guide ' 13 ' ' and ' ' Eating Out West 2013/14 ' ' , the latter title reflecting the title of the magazine 's own predecessor . # Website # The Venue website , one of the longest-running commercial websites in the UK , was originally set up in 1995 . Since the demise of the printed ' ' Venue ' ' magazine , the website continues to include event listings , music , theatre and comedy reviews , selected features from the Bristol Post 's Weekend supplement , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements section . Venue Magazine Final Post . The Venue website was closed by Local World at 11am on Friday November 29 , 2013 . Venue writers and photographers etc. published an open letter on the site which subsequently went viral and was picked up by Buzzfeed http : **91;101543;TOOLONG
