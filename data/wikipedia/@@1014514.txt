Another Brick in the Wall is the title of three songs set to variations of the same basic theme , on Pink Floyd 's 1979 rock opera , ' ' The Wall ' ' , subtitled Part 1 ( working title Reminiscing ) , Part 2 ( working title Education ) , and Part 3 ( working title Drugs ) . All parts were written by Pink Floyd 's bassist , Roger Waters . Part II is a protest song against rigid schooling in general and boarding schools in the UK in particular . It was also released as a single and provided the band 's only number-one hit in the United Kingdom , the United States , West Germany and many other countries . In addition , in the US , along with the tracks , Run Like Hell , and Do n't Leave Me Now , Another Brick in the Wall reached number fifty-seven on the disco chart . In the UK , it was Pink Floyd 's first single since 1968 's Point Me at the Sky ; the song was also the final number-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd received a Grammy nomination for Best Performance by a Rock Duo or Group and lost to Bob Seger 's Against the Wind . In addition , Part II was number 375 on ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . The single sold over 4 million copies worldwide . The single , as well as the album ' ' The Wall ' ' , were banned in South Africa in 1980 after the song was adopted by supporters of a nationwide school boycott protesting racial inequities in education under the apartheid regime . # Concept # Each of the three parts has a similar tune , and lyrical structure ( though not lyrics , aside from the all in all refrain ) , and each is louder and more enraged than the one before , rising from the sadness of Part I to the protesting Part II to the furious Part III . # ' ' Part 1 ' ' # ; Composition Part 1 of the song is very quiet dynamically and features a long , subdued guitar solo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parts 2 and 3 , although there is a short , sharp rise in dynamics and tone for a brief period towards the end of the lyrical portion . Sniffing , shouting , wailing , calling , and children can be faintly heard in the background . The song 's beginning coincides with the final chord of The Thin Ice , and the echoing multi-guitar solo ( after the lyrics ) crossfades into the helicopter and yelling-teacher sounds of The Happiest Days of Our Lives . ; Plot The Thin Ice discussed during the previous song breaks when Pink becomes older and learns of the death of his father . Pink is devastated by this reality and begins to build The Wall . ; Film version Pink 's mother is seen praying in a church after the death of her husband overseas . Pink , however , is , at this point , oblivious of his death , and can be seen playing with a toy aeroplane . The song continues with Pink playing in a public park after his mother leaves him to go shopping . He sees a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own father . The man gives Pink a lift onto a ride , and it 's clear Pink feels as if this man is his real father . Pink follows the man 's son around , copying him , but does n't understand why the other boy 's father is n't paying attention to him . He grabs the man 's hand but is shooed away , only to grab the man 's hand again . The man pushes Pink away again , and dejectedly he sits on a swing ( which is too far off the ground for him to swing himself ) . He looks over at the other parents swinging their kids , feeling even more alone . # ' ' Part 2 ' ' # ; Composition In the album version of ' ' The Wall ' ' , Another Brick in the Wall ( Part 2 ) segues from The Happiest Days of Our Lives , with Roger Waters ' signature scream . The song has strong drums , a well-known bass line and distinctive guitar parts in the background with a smooth , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schoolchildren singing in the second verse : as the song ends , the sounds of a school yard are heard , along with a Scots teacher who continues to lord it over the children 's lives by shouting Wrong ! Do it again ! , and If you do n't eat yer meat , you ca n't have any pudding ! ' ' How ' ' can you have any pudding if you do n't eat yer meat ? ! , and You ! Yes ! You behind the bikesheds ! Stand ' ' still ' ' , laddie ! , all of it dissolving into the dull drone of a phone ringing and ending with a deep sigh . ; School choir Producer Bob Ezrin had immediately recognised the hit potential of this song , but it took some manoeuvring behind the band 's back until Part II took its eventual form . It was Ezrin 's idea to use a school choir for this song , as he explained to Guitar World in 2009 : The most important thing I did for the song was to insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , which it was when Roger wrote it . When we played it with the disco drumbeat I said : Man , this is a hit ! But it 's one minute 20 . We need two verses and two choruses . And they said , Well you 're not bloody getting them . We do n't do singles , so fuck you . So I said , Okay , fine , and they left . And because of our two tape recorder set up , while they were n't around we were able to copy the first verse and chorus , take one of the drum fills , put them in between and extend the chorus . Then the question is what do you do with the second verse , which is the same ? And having been the guy who made Alice Cooper 's ' ' School 's Out ( album ) Griffiths approached music teacher Alun Renshaw of Islington Green School , around the corner from Pink Floyd 's Britannia Row Studios , about the choir . Though the school received a lump sum payment of 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales . Under a 1996 UK copyright law , they became eligible for royalties from broadcasts , and after royalties agent Peter Rowan traced choir members through the website Friends Reunited and other means , they lodged a claim for royalties with the Performing Artists ' Media Rights Association in 2004 . ; Disco beat The idea for the disco beat came likewise from Ezrin . As David Gilmour explained in 2009 : Of the final outcome , Roger Waters has commented : David Gilmour said : ; Plot After being insulted by the teacher , Pink dreams that the kids in his school begin to protest against their abusive teachers . The song talks about how he had a personal wall around him from the rest of the world , the teachers were just another brick in the wall . ; Film version Following The Happiest Days of Our Lives Pink starts to daydream during his class . He imagines several students marching in unison to the beat of the song , following a path until they enter a steamy tunnel section to re-emerge as putty-faced clones void of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starting with Gilmour 's guitar solo , the children destroy the school building using hammers ( foreshadowing the subsequent neo-fascist Nazi-like animated sequence with its marching hammers ) and crowbars , creating a bonfire , dragging their teacher out of the burning school kicking and screaming while chanting We do n't need no education . The song ends with Pink rubbing his hand , which the teacher slapped with a ruler in the song previously . During the song , the teacher 's meat and pudding lines are folded into the first few lines of the school choir 's lines ( with the instrumental breaks between shortened by a bar in 2 places ) , and are performed by the teacher in the film , played by Alex McAvoy . ; Music video Prior to the film , the first video for the track , directed by album/concert/film art designer Gerald Scarfe , depicted students running in a playground ( Kings Square Gardens , Islington ) and the teacher puppet from ' ' The Wall ' ' concerts was used . The video also mixed in some animated scenes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opening shot , a pan across the London skyline was filmed from the top of Turnpike House in Islington , both St Lukes Church and St Clements Church ( the one overlooking the playground ) are both clearly visible in the shot . After the media furore surrounding the song , the Islington Green school head teacher Margaret Maden refused permission for the children who sang on the song to appear in the video or on ' ' Top of the Pops ' ' , although at the time they were told it was because they did n't hold Equity Cards . Once the film was completed , the actual scenes of The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall , Part II were combined into a new video , which now represents the music video for Another Brick in the Wall . ; Live Versions When performed as part of the various live shows of ' ' The Wall ' ' , the teacher is represented by a giant inflatable puppet , based on the figure from Scarfe 's animations .

These are backed by Guy Pratt 's slap bass lines .
