Alkborough is a parish of 458 people in 192 households ( 2011 census ) in North Lincolnshire , England , located near the northern end of The Cliff range of hills overlooking the Humber Estuary at the Trent Falls , the confluence of the River Trent and the River Ouse . Alkborough , with the hamlet of Walcot about 1 mi south , forms a civil parish which covers about 2875acre km2 . The village was once thought to be the location that the Romans called ' ' Aquis ' ' , but that name is now usually associated with the town of Buxton in Derbyshire ( ' ' Aquis Arnemetiae ' ' ) . # History # Alkborough is listed as Alchebarge in the ' ' Domesday Book ' ' . Eminson translates this as the ridge-like cliff above the mooring pool of the river . It was located at Alkborough Priory is included in the English Heritage Archive ( Number : SE 82 SE 7 , Monument Number : 61223 ) . # Wartime # # #Bombing range# # Alkborough Flats was home to a bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summary of an oral history provided by an Alkborough resident who was school age during Second World War : # The bombing range itself took the form of a chalk marker on Alkborough Flats , and two observation posts positioned on the ridge overlooking the target . An RAF detachment from RAF Elsham Wolds , including two sergeants , were billeted in the southern of the two observation posts . Bombers would take off from Elsham , and drop smoke bombs on the target . Following a bombing run , a bearing on the bomb 's landing site was taken from each observation post , and the position of the site calculated using triangulation . During one bombing run , a horse was killed , and another bomb narrowly missed a group of children sledging . After the war , agricultural workers ploughing on the Flats regularly reported releasing smoke . During the establishment of the Alkborough Flats Tidal Defence Scheme in 2005/2006 , a large quantity of World War II ordnance was removed from the site under supervision of bomb disposal officers . Currently , very little remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern observation post is still standing ( including the observation windows ) . # The southern observation post was located at , and the northern at . They are both accessible to the public via a public footpath . The location of the chalk target marker is not known exactly , but was somewhere to the west of the new bird hide , which is located at . # #Defensive structures# # A number of Second World War defensive structures were also located in the Alkborough area , including : *Three searchlight batteries . One of these ( Site 3 ) was located just west of Whitton Road , at . It was manned by 1 Troop of 323 Searchlight Battery from October 1941 . It was established as part of a special deployment of searchlights to defend the Humber estuary , complimenting existing local searchlight batteries. ) . # Conservation Area # The older part of Alkborough , including Julian 's Bower , Countess Close , and Walcot , lies within a Conservation Area . # Geography # Alkborough is situated on an escarpment formed of Triassic Mudstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The steep mudstone escarpment is to the west , with a shallow slope to the east formed from shale of the Lower Lias in the Jurassic system . # Alkborough Flats # Alkborough Flats is an area of low-lying arable farmland of nearly 990acre km2 situated at the Confluence of the Rivers ( Trent Falls ) where the Rivers Trent and Ouse join to form the Humber estuary . The alluvial plain and is now jointly owned by the UK 's Environment Agency and English Nature . Flood defences which were built in the 1950s to protect the area have been breached to allow water to reclaim the land at high tide and in times of flooding . The project created 495acre km2 of new intertidal habitat in the inner part of the Humber estuary . The new grassland will be managed to encourage biodiversity , with reedbeds , lagoons and grazing areas . Alkborough Flats is the first coastal realignment site to be developed as part of the Humber Shoreline Management Plan . This managed retreat strategy should lessen the risks of flooding in low-lying towns along the Ouse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat around the estuary . # Walcot # Walcot is an outlying hamlet situated to the south of Alkborough , and within the same Parish . # Landmarks # # Julian 's Bower # Close to the Cliff edge is Julian 's Bower , a unicursal turf maze , 43 feet ( 13 m ) across , of indeterminate age . Although referred to as a maze , being unicursal ( having only one way in and one path through ) it is more accurately a labyrinth . According to Arthur Mee 's book ' ' Lincolnshire ' ' the maze was cut by monks in the 12th century , but White 's ' ' Lincolnshire Directory ' ' of 1872 maintains that it was constructed in Roman times as part of a game . Others think that while the feature is of Roman origin , it was later used by the Medieval Church for some sort of penitential purpose and only reverted to its former use as an amusement or diversion , after the Reformation . Firm documentary evidence of its existence only seems to date from 1697 however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yorkshire antiquary Abraham de la Pryme . Several families have occupied the building , including the Marriotts , Stricklands , Constables and Legards . It was bought by the current owners in 2004 . It is currently used to cater for weddings and corporate events . It is located at # Kell Well # Kell Well is a spring that discharges from a point just below the top of The Cliff escarpment , west of Walcot . However , due to Danish influence the name is not uncommon for springs in eastern England , ' ' keld ' ' being a Danish word for ' ' spring pool ' ' . * # Low Wells # Low Wells is a spring that discharges from a point just the south side of Prospect Lane , north of ( and several yards below ) St John the Baptist Church . There is no evidence suggesting how the spring became known as Low Wells , though its position below the level of the main part of the village would seem to suggest an obvious answer . The well takes the form of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the water flows . This well-structure is thought to have been constructed c.1850 . As this arrangement was probably to facilitate the watering of livestock , a pump was installed nearby to tap the springs first and provide clean drinking water for villagers , though this has now gone . This well structure is thought to have been constructed c.1850 , and was restored in 1986 . Low Wells is accessible to the public from Prospect Lane , and is located at coordinates . # Apex Light # By a quirk of the Alkborough &amp; Walcot Parish boundary , the Trent Falls light known as Apex Light lies within the parish . This is despite it being ' attached ' to the opposite bank of the River Trent , and inaccessible from Alkborough .
