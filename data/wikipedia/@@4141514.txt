Bulgarian grammar is the body of rules that describe the structure of expressions in the Bulgarian language . The language is a South Slavic language that historically evolved from the Old Bulgarian languagealso known as Old Slavonic language which was the written norm for the Slavic languages in the Middle agesand before that from the Proto-Slavic language . Bulgarian is also a part of the Balkan language area , which also includes Greek , Macedonian , Romanian , Albanian and the Torlakian dialect of the Serbian language . As such , it shares several grammatical innovations with the other southwest Balkan languages that set it apart from other Slavic languages . These include a sharp reduction in noun inflections ; most Bulgarian nouns and adjectives are inflected for number and gender , but have lost noun cases . Bulgarian also has a suffixed definite article , while most other Slavic languages have no definite article at all . Bulgarian has also lost the verb infinitive , while otherwise preserving most of the complexities of the Old Bulgarian verb conjugation system , and has further developed the proto-Slavic verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and doubtful ( ' ' irrealis ' ' ) actions . # Nouns # Bulgarian nouns have the categories grammatical gender , number , case ( only vocative ) and definiteness . A noun has one of three specific grammatical genders ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) and two numbers ( singular and plural ) . With cardinal numbers and some adverbs , masculine nouns use a separate count form  ( see below )  . The plural is formed by adding to or replacing the singular ending , most commonly in the following ways : Definiteness is expressed by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun : When the two are combined , the plural ending comes first : # Bulgarian case system # Bulgarian derives a system of six cases , but only three , the accusative , dative , and nominative , and only in personal and interrogative pronouns , remain intact from Old Bulgarian . While Bulgarian has lost most of its declensions , many remnants of the old more complex case system do still exist . These remnants make up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their rarity , however , they are no longer seen as case endings , but are rather considered to be part of some completely different phenomenon , such as being a subcategory of the definite article or of the plural , as with the genitive below . * apart from only appearing in pronouns , the accusative and the dative have mostly merged as an oblique case ** The two cases are preserved in the personal pronouns , but only in their short forms - e.g. ' ' me ' ' ( me ) , ' ' mi ' ' ( to me ) ; ' ' ya ' ' ( her ) ; ' ' i ' ' ( to her ) . While the dative case has a long form , it is archaic and instead accusative constructions with the word ' ' na ' ' ( to ) are usually used . ** Also , they appear in the masculine of some key words such as the interrogative pronoun ' ' ( koy ) ' ' who and its derivatives , and in some other related words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , ' ' vsekigo ' ' ( acc. ) , ' ' vsekimu ' ' ( dat . ) . This usage is becoming ever rarer , especially in the spoken language . * the genitive is preserved in the ' ' masculine singular ' ' however , it is not used exclusively in genitive constructions any more . Instead , it has become the incomplete definite article suffix ( ' ' nepulen chlen ' ' ) , used with all definite masculine nouns which are the ' ' object ' ' of a sentence : ** stol ( a chair ) stol ' ' at ' ' ( the chair , subject ) pod stol ' ' a ' ' ( under the chair - object ) . * the vocative ** for family members - e.g. ' ' ' ' ( ' ' maika maiko ' ' - mother ) ** for masculine names - e.g. ( Petar Petre ) ** in social descriptors - e.g. priatel ' ' yu ' ' ( friend ) , uchitel ' ' yu ' ' ( teacher ) * the instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noshtem ' ' ( during the night , from ' ' nosht ' ' ) ; ' ' sbogom ' ' ( farewell - lit. with God , from ' ' s + bog ' ' ) ; or ' ' begom ' ' ( while running from ' ' byagam ' ' - to run ) # Remnant of the dual # : ' ' See also : Language and Nouns articles ' ' In Bulgarian , the numerical plural form ' ' ( broyna mnozhestvena forma ) ' ' is a remnant of the grammatical dual number , which disappeared from the language in the Middle Ages . The modern numerical form is used in the masculine whenever there is a ' ' precise amount ' ' of something , regardless of the actual number , e.g. * stol ( chair ) mnogo stol ' ' ove ' ' ( many chairs - general plural ) dva stol ' ' a ' ' /deset stol ' ' a ' ' ( two chairs/ten chairs - numerical plural ) . # Adjectives # A Bulgarian adjective agrees in gender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is put usually before it . The comparative and the superlative form are formed analytically . # Pronouns # Bulgarian pronouns vary in gender , number , definiteness and case . The distinguishable types of pronouns include the following : personal , possessive , interrogative , demonstrative , reflexive , summative , negative , indefinite and relative . # Verbs # ' ' Bulgarian verbs are the most complicated part of Bulgarian grammar . They are inflected for person , number and sometimes gender . They also have lexical aspect ( perfective and imperfective ) , voice , nine tenses , five moods and six non-finite verbal forms . Bulgarian verbs are divided into three conjugations. # Voice # The voice in Bulgarian adjectives is presented by the ending on the past participle ; the auxiliary remains ' ' ' ' ( to be ) : * Active - ' ' .. - udar il sum ... ' ' - I have hit ... * Passive - ' ' - udar en sum ' ' - I have been hit # Mood # Mood in Bulgarian is expressed not through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( che ) ' ' and ' ' ( da ) ' ' ( which both translate as the relative pronoun ' ' that ' ' ) . The verbs remain unchanged . Thus : * Indicative - - ** e.g. ' ' , - znam , che si tuk ' ' - I know that you are here ; * Subjunctive - - ** e.g. ' ' - iskam da si tuk ' ' - I want that you are here , I want you to be here The inferential is formed in exactly the same way as the perfect , but with the omission of the auxiliary : * Perfect - ' ' - toy e bil ' ' - he has been * Inferential - ' ' - toy bil ' ' - he ( reportedly ) was The imperative has its own conjugation - usually by adding ' ' - ' ' or ' ' - ' ' ( ' ' -i ' ' or ' ' -ay ' ' ) to the root of the verb : * e.g. sit - ' ' ' ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ' ' ( ' ' sedna sedni ' ' perfective ) . ** Negative instructions - either ' ' ne syaday ' ' or ' ' nedey da syadash ' ' - do n't sit down . ( See section on ' ' intentional particles ' ' . ) # Word order # Although Bulgarian has almost no noun cases its word order is rather free . It is even freer than the word order of some languages that have cases , for example German . This is due to the agreement between the subject and the verb of a sentence . So in Bulgarian the sentence I saw Lubomir can be expressed thus : . saw-1pSg Lyubomir ( ) . Lyubomir ( him ) saw-1pSg It is clear that the subject is ( I ) ( it has been dropped ) , because the verb is in the first person singular . Other examples - Ivan greeted the girls : . Ivan greeted-3pSg girls-the . ( ) . Girls-the ( them ) greeted-3pSg Ivan . . Ivan girls-the greeted-3pSg . ( ) . Girls-the Ivan ( them ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeted-3pSg ( them ) girls-the Ivan . Theoretically all permutations are possible but the last one sounds rather odd . The girls greeted Ivan : . Girls-the greeted-3pPl Ivan . ( ) . Ivan ( him ) greeted-3pPl girls-the . . Girls-the Ivan greeted-3pPl . ( ) . Ivan girls-the ( him ) greeted-3pPl . . Greeted-3pPl girls-the Ivan . ( ) . Greeted-3pPl ( him ) Ivan girls-the . The clitic doubling ( / ) is obligatory only when the subject and the object are both in third person , and they are either both singular or both plural , but when the meaning is clear from the context it can be omitted . Examples : . Ivan him greeted-3pSg Maria . Maria greeted Ivan . . Maria her greeted-3pSg Ivan . Ivan greeted Maria . but .. Roles-the sound-screened-3pPl artists-the ... The artists ... ( their names ) sound-screened the roles . ( They made the soundtrack for the film . ) In the compound tenses , when a participle is used , and when the subject and the object are of different gender or number , the clitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the above examples can be expressed in a compound tense thus : ( ) . Ivan ( him ) has greeted-3pSgFem Maria . Maria has greeted Ivan . ( ) . Maria ( her ) has greeted-3pSgMasc Ivan . Ivan has greeted Maria . The above two examples sound a bit odd without the doubling , unless it is a case of topicalization and special stress is put on the first word . # Other # # Numbers # In Bulgarian , the numbers 1 and 2 take gender . Furthermore , numbers take special endings when : * referring to men ( 2-6 and 10 , and 20-100 ) - add ' ' -ma ' ' ** e.g. 2 chairs - ' ' dva stola ' ' ; 2 brothers - ' ' dva ma bratya ' ' * referring to a roundabout number ( 10-100 and , rarely , 5-9 ) - add ' ' -ina ' ' ** e.g. ' ' dvadeset dushi ' ' - 20 people ; ' ' dvadeset ina dushi ' ' - about 20 people * they are used as common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / ' ' -tsa ' ' ** ' ' sedem ' ' - seven , but ' ' sedmitza ' ' - the number seven ( as in the seven in a deck of cards , or bus number seven , etc . ) . ' ' Notes : ' ' * In Bulgarian , numbers can be used directly in front of uncountable nouns - e.g. ' ' vod ' ' water ' ' edna voda ' ' a glass of water ( the quantifier ' ' ' glass of ' ' ' is inferred from the context - comp . English ' ' ' a beer ) . * The word ' ' edni ' ' can be translated as some - e.g. ' ' edni tzigari ' ' some cigarettes ( comp . Spanish ' ' unos/unas ' ' ) . * When counting , the ' ' neuter ' ' numbers are taken - ' ' edno , dve , tri ... ' ' . * Fractions are the same as the ordinal numbers , and are done in the feminine 1/5 - edna peta , 2/5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used by themselves , without a noun following - e.g. simply vidyah dvama - I saw two men , or even colloquially edni dvama .. - these two men ... * Irregularly , sedmina and osmina can be used ( archaically , poetically ) to also mean 7/8 men rather than around 7/8 . * The smaller denomination of the Bulgarian currency - the ' ' stotnka ( pl. stotnki ) ' ' literally mean hundredths ( diminutive ) ; 100 stotinki = 1 lev . # References #
