We 've got the election here in town , Port Vila , and Efate , the island on which it 's situated , and then the rest of the country where 80 per cent of the population lives . And I say that because in the lead up to the election a lot of the media , a lot of the analysts were predicting a mood for change . I think what we forgot in that debate , or in that discussion in the lead up to the election , what was the rest of the country talking about . The rural areas where the majority of people do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years , radio because there 's been a problem with the transmitter . And in a lot of cases the rural electorate has been totally disengaged from both the government process and certainly the political process . It 's not about policy basis down there . It 's about patronage . It 's about personalities . ' ' # References #
