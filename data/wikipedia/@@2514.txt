The latitude of the city that would become Aswan located at 24 5 23 was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers . They believed that it was seated immediately under the tropic , and that on the day of the summer solstice , a vertical staff cast no shadow . They noted that the sun 's disc was reflected in a well at noon . This statement is only approximately correct ; at the summer solstice , the shadow was only  1  /  400  th of the staff , and so could scarcely be discerned , and the northern limb of the Sun 's disc would be nearly vertical . However , Eratosthenes used this information together with measurements of the shadow length on the solstice at Alexandria to perform the first known calculation of the circumference of the Earth . The Nile is nearly 2.7 m wide above Aswan . From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt , the river flows for more than without bar or cataract .
