Uchide-no-Kozuchi ( ) is a legendary Japanese magic hammer This treasure is also rendered into English as magic wishing mallet the mallet of fortune , etc . In popular belief , magic wooden hammer is a standard item held in the hand of the iconic deity Daikoku-ten , who is often represented as figurines , statues , netsukes , and in architecture . It is also a stock item in popular tales . In ' ' Issun-bshi ' ' ( ' ' One-Inch Boy ' ' ) , the hero gains the mallet defeating an ogre ( oni ) and amass wealth , while in modern embelishments , he even transforms himself into full adult-size . In ' ' Momotar ' ' ( Peach Boy ) , the mallet is captured from the ogres in Onigashima , alongside the ' ' kakure mino ' ' ( raincoat of invisibility ) and ' ' kakurekasa ' ' ( hat of invisibility ) **25;171747;ref renders the others as the magical cloak , the cap of invisibility which is redundant ; perhaps for the latter cap .

It can be traced at as far back as The Tale of Heike ( ca. 1240 ) , or , if the instance of use in the work has any historicity , datable to before ca. 1118 . In folkloristics , the uchide no kozuchi is catalogued in the Stith Thompson motif index scheme under magic hammer , D 1470.1.46 . # Issun bshi # In the legend , the one-inch tall Issun-boshi , after leaving his parent 's home , comes under the employ of a wealthy daimyo , whose daughter is an attractive princess . Although scorned for his height , he is given the job of accompanying the princess . While traveling together , they are attacked by an Oni , who deals with pesky Issun-boshi by swallowing him . He defeats the Oni by pricking him from within with his needle/sword . The Oni spits out Issun-boshi and drops the ' Uchide-no-Kozuchi as he runs away . In the ' ' otogizshi ' ' , he then shakes out opulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the better-known modernized versions , the princess uses the power of the mallet to grow him to full size . At the end of the story , Issun-bshi and the princess are married . # History # # Etymology # The word ' ' uchi de no kozuchi ' ' literally translates to striking-out little hammer , or hammer that strikes anything out that is desired . In plainer speech it is understood that the hammer is to be shaken or swung . # Early usage # According to the ' ' Hbutsush ' ' ja ( 1179 ) , the mallet is a wonderful treasure , such that when one goes out into a wide open field , it can be used to tap out a mansion , amusing men and women , useful servants , horse and cattle , food , and articles of clothing . However , all the items wished for reputed disappear at the sound of the bell tolling ( hence the necessity of using it in a vacant field ) , and the moral of this Buddhist sermon-type tale ( setsuwa ) is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Heike is an anecdote whereby a strangely outfitted person moving about in the night , is mistaken for an ogre ( oni ) , and his kindling wood mistaken for the ' ' uchide no kozuchi ' ' , attesting to the belief even then that this was a treasure reputedly owned by the ogres . The anecdote occurs in scroll 6 of ' ' Heike ' ' , under the chapter on ( Lady Gion ) . One night , near Gion Shrine , a figure is witnessed seemingly with hair like a bed of silver needles , and something glowing in his hand , which people feared to be an ogre , carrying the uchide no kozuchi for which these demon-kind beings are famous . The imperial guardsman Tadamori was ordered to investigate , and he discovered it was just a priest trying to illuminate a light in the chapel . The priest had put straws in his head to prevent getting damp . The same anecdote also occurs in the ' ' Genpei jsuiki ' ' , which states that the priest was blowing on the embers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he did the straws on his head would illuminate and appear like silver needles . If this was a historical event , it happened sometime before or around the time when Kiyomori ( born 1118 ) was conceived by the Lady Nyogo , who was then mistress to Retired Emperor Shirakawa , and Kiyomori 's putative father Tadamori being the guardsman sent on the oni-hunt ; but the tale is likely a fable about Kiyomori 's royal parentage . It has been observed that the treasures of the oni in the later tale of Momotar incorporated this older lore about treasures the ogres possessed . It has been observed that the same set of treasures as Momotar 's oni , or practically so , are described in ' ' The Tale of Hgen ' ' , regarding Minamoto no Tametomo traveling to Onigashima island . Tametomo discovers that the islanders claimed to be descendants of oni , and named their now-lost treasures as the cloak of invisibility , the hat of invisibility , floating shoes , sinking shoes , and sword in some texts , and in older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' uchide no kutsu ' ' ( shoes of wishing ) , a likely scribal error for ' ' uchide no kozuchi ' ' according to scholars . # Popular culture # * The hammer , called the Midge Mallet , is used in the video game ' ' Secret of Mana ' ' to make playable characters smaller or to grow back to normal size . * In the video game ' ' kami ' ' , there is a character called Issun ( who is loosely based on Issun-boshi ) who follows the main character . Along with Issun , the Uchide 's Mallet ( referred to as the Lucky Mallet in the English localization ) also appears in the game , although it is used to shrink the protagonist ( a wolf avatar of the Shinto sun goddess Okami Amaterasu ) instead , to Issun 's size ( rather than the other way around ) granting one access to otherwise inaccessible areas . After obtaining it from the Sunken Ship , the mallet is shown to have a will of its own as it flies away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to it they discover that the mallet was not trying to run away , but instead was helping them in locating the source of a poisonous mist ( which has been causing problems for Amaterasu and Issun ) , and its shrinking power helps them sneak into the Imperial Palace , eventually allowing them to enter the Emperor 's body and defeat the boss Blight ( source of the poison mist ) . * In the video game ' ' The World Ends with You ' ' , is one of several secret items that can be found by the player after beating the game . It is an accessory that increases the amount of experience the wearer gets ( unlike the legend it has no effect on the characters size in the game and is simply just another accessory which is reference to the Japanese legend ) . Its in-game description is The miniature golden hammer of Muromachi-period legends that lets you change your height at will . Perfect for short folks ! ( referencing the legend ) . Random NPCs also makes a reference to the legendary hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item is ' ' Lucky Mallet ' ' . * In the anime series , Folktales from Japan , the Mallet appears twice in the series . First in the 2nd and later in 63rd episode of the series ; both appears are in the segment named Little One Inch . * Some ' ' Maneki Neko ' ' figures also appear with the ' ' Uchide no kozuchi ' ' in the right hand , evoking Daikoku-ten. * The hammer is a recurring item in early Final Fantasy games and is used to cure the user of the status effect ' Small ' . * In the 14th Touhou game ' ' Double Dealing Character ' ' , the final boss , named Sukuna Shinmyoumaru , is both based on and claims to be a descendant of Issun-boshi . She is holding a needle , a bowl for a hat , and the Uchide 's Mallet , which is responsible for much of the game 's plot .
