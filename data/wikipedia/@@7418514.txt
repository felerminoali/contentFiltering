Gao Cheng ( ) ( 521549 ) , courtesy name Zihui ( ) , formally Prince Wenxiang of Bohai ( ) , later further posthumously honored by Northern Qi as Emperor Wenxiang ( ) with the temple name Shizong ( ) , was the paramount official of the Chinese/Xianbei state Eastern Wei , a branch successor state of Northern Wei . He was Gao Huan 's oldest son , and because his father wielded actual power during Emperor Xiaojing 's reign , Gao Cheng also received increasingly great authority , and after his father 's death in 547 took over the rein of the state . He was considered capable but frivolous and arrogant , as well as lacking in sexual discretion . In 549 , he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing ( ) , and his younger brother Gao Yang took over the control over the Eastern Wei regime . # Background # Gao Cheng was born in 521 , when his father Gao Huan was still a courier of documents between the Northern Wei capital Luoyang and the old capital Pingcheng ( , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from a wealthy family , but Gao Huan 's own household was poor . In 525 , the ambitious Gao Huan joined the agrarian rebellion led by Du Luozhou ( ) , but subsequently became convinced that Du was not a successful leader , and sought to flee from Du 's camp with his associates Wei Jing ( ) , Duan Rong ( ) , and Cai Jun ( ) . ( Wei and Duan were also his brothers-in-law . ) Lady Lou and her children ( Gao Cheng and a daughter ) fled as well , riding a cow . During this flight , Gao Cheng repeatedly fell off the cow , and Gao Huan considered killing him with an arrow , but Duan repeatedly saved him . The next known incident involving Gao Cheng was in 531 , when Gao , then a Northern Wei general , rebelled against the members of Erzhu Rong 's clan ( who had dominated the political scene after they defeated Emperor Xiaozhuang in revenge of Emperor Xiaozhuang 's killing of Erzhu Rong ) , and when an agrarian rebel leader , Gao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huan 's , refused to follow Gao Huan , Gao Huan sent Gao Cheng to visit Gao Aocao and showing respect due a granduncle , persuading Gao Aocao of Gao Huan 's sincerity . # During Gao Huan 's lifetime # Gao Huan defeated the Erzhus in 532 and entered Luoyang victoriously , and he made Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang emperor ( as Emperor Xiaowu ) . As a result of Gao Huan 's victory , the 11-year-old Gao Cheng received high ranking titles , even though he appeared to carry no actual responsibility by this point in either the imperial administration or his father 's army . With his father having been created the Prince of Bohai , Gao Cheng , as his oldest son , also carried the title the Heir Apparent of Bohai . In 534 , Emperor Xiaowu , in a dispute with Gao Huan over the control of power , fled to the domain of the independent general Yuwen Tai , leading to a split of Northern Wei , as Gao Huan then made Yuan Shanjian the Heir Apparent of Qinghe emperor ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's control became known as Eastern Wei , and the areas under Yuwen 's control became known as Western Wei . Gao Huan moved the Eastern Wei capital from Luoyang to Yecheng . In 535 , Gao Huan found out that Gao Cheng had been conducting an affair with Gao Huan 's concubine Lady Zheng Dache ( ) . In anger , he caned Gao Cheng 100 times and put him under arrest , and he seriously considered making Gao You ( ) , his son by his concubine Lady Erzhu Ying'e ( Erzhu Rong 's daughter ) heir apparent to replace Gao Cheng . Gao Cheng sought help from Gao Huan 's friend Sima Ziru ( ) , who persuaded Gao Huan to change his mind by reminding him the contributions that Gao Cheng 's mother Princess Lou had made , and also subsequently by forcing the witnesses to the affair between Gao Cheng and Lady Zheng to recant . Still , Princess Lou and Gao Cheng were forced to repeatedly bow and crawl on the ground to beg Gao Huan 's forgiveness , and Gao Huan allowed Gao Cheng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gao Cheng , who was then with his father at his military headquarters of Jinyang , requested permission to become in charge of the Eastern Wei imperial government at Yecheng . Gao Huan initially refused , but Gao Huan 's assistant Sun Qian ( ) spoke on Gao Cheng 's behalf , and finally Gao Huan agreed . Gao Cheng soon arrived at Yecheng and took over the imperial administration . He became known as a harsh but capable enforcer of laws , in comparison to his father 's policy of relaxed enforcement . He also abolished the seniority-based system of promotion that had caused the imperial administration to stagnate , seeking out capable individuals and promoting them quickly . Around this time , Gao Cheng also married Emperor Xiaojing 's sister the Princess Fengyi as his wife . In 540 , she bore him a son , Gao Xiaowan ( ) . The emperor personally went to his mansion to congratulate him , and the officials all sent expensive gifts . ( Gao Cheng initially declined , stating that Gao Xiaocheng was the emperor 's nephew , and therefore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In 543 , the actions of Gao Cheng and his trusted assistant , Cui Xian ( ) , would lead to the rebellion of the general Gao Zhongmi ( ) . Gao Zhongmi had earlier married Cui 's sister as his wife , but later abandoned her , and this led to hatred between Gao Zhongmi and Cui . Cui therefore found many reasons to pick fault with selections of officials that Gao Zhongmi had made , and Gao Cheng agreed with Cui . Further , on one occasion , when Gao Cheng saw Gao Zhongmi 's new wife Li Changyi ( ) , he was stunned by her beauty and tried to rape her . Lady Li escaped , and informed Gao Zhongmi about the incident . Therefore , when Gao Zhongmi became the governor of Northern Yu Province ( , roughly modern Zhengzhou , Henan ) , he surrendered the capital of Northern Yu Province , the key garrison Hulao ( ) , to Western Wei . ( Gao Huan , blaming Cui for Gao Zhongmi 's rebellion , initially wanted to kill Cui or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying the influence that he had on his father by this point , was able to persuade Gao Huan , through Gao Huan 's assistant Chen Yuanda ( ) , that punishing Cui would undermine Gao Cheng 's authority , and therefore Gao Huan never did punish Cui . ) In the ensuing battles over the control of the Hulao and Luoyang region , both Yuwen Tai and Gao Huan nearly died . After Eastern Wei forces finally captured Hulao later that year , and Lady Li was delivered to Yecheng , Gao Cheng made her one of his concubines . In 544 , Gao Huan , believing that the officials Sima Ziru , Sun Teng ( ) , Gao Yue ( , Gao Huan 's cousin ) , and Gao Longzhi ( ) , were becoming too powerful and too corrupt , transferred major portions of those officials ' responsibilities to Gao Cheng . Gao Cheng further showed off his authority by acting imperiously toward those officials . For example , when Sun once visited him and showed insufficient respect , he had his guards throw Sun on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed his assistant Cui Jishu ( , Cui Xian 's uncle ) as Emperor Xiaojing 's secretary , to keep watch on Emperor Xiaojing . Later in 544 , Gao Cheng , wanting to stamp out corruption within the imperial administration , empowered Cui Xian and Song Youdao ( ) to investigate high level officials for corruption . Cui and Song each made several accusations against high level officials , and Gao Cheng had , in particular , Sima Ziru stripped of all titles and offices , and Yuan Tan ( ) the Prince of Xianyang stripped of his offices . In order to show that Cui , in particular , was empowered to carry out investigations , Gao Cheng had Cui intentionally show disrespect to himself in public with impunity , so that the officials would be even more apprehensive of Cui . In late 546 , Gao Huan became seriously ill , and he summoned Gao Cheng back to Jinyang to entrust the matters to him . At that time , Gao Cheng was apprehensive that the general Hou Jing , who commanded the provinces south of the Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of officials that he could trust , and specifically instructed him to make Murong Shaozong ( ) the commander of the army against Hou if Hou rebelled . Gao Huan died in spring 547 , but Gao Cheng , also pursuant to Gao Huan 's instructions , did not announce Gao Huan 's death in public ; rather , he returned to Yecheng , pretending that Gao Huan was still alive . # As regent # Also in spring 547 , Hou Jing , unsure whether Gao Huan was still alive but believing that Gao Huan had died , rebelled , first surrendering the 13 provinces he commanded to Western Wei , and then to Liang Dynasty . Gao Cheng initially sent Han Gui ( ) against Hou , and Han had some successes against Hou 's forces , but was forced to withdraw when Western Wei forces arrived , taking four of Hou 's provinces in exchange for supporting Hou . Subsequently , Hou broke with Western Wei , and Western Wei forces withdrew . Meanwhile , Emperor Wu of Liang commissioned his nephew Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gao Cheng , after finally revealing Gao Huan 's death , put Murong Shaozong in charge of the army . He also made peace overtures to Hou , promising to keep him in command of the southern provinces if he would submit . Hou refused . Meanwhile , Gao Cheng also had a threat from within . Gao Cheng , once Gao Huan died , began to show contempt for Emperor Xiaojing , and once , when Emperor Xiaojing rebuked him for public disrespect , Gao Cheng ordered Cui Jishu to punch Emperor Xiaojing three times . Emperor Xiaojing , fearful of what might come next , formed a conspiracy against Gao Cheng . In winter 547 , the plot was discovered , and Gao Cheng put the emperor under arrest and executed his coconspirators . Late in 547 , Murong Shaozong crushed Xiao Yuanming 's army at Hanshan ( , in modern Xuzhou , Jiangsu ) , capturing Xiao Yuanming . When Xiao Yuanming was delivered to Gao Cheng , Gao Cheng treatedly him with respect , intending to try to use Xiao Yuanming as a pawn against Hou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's army as well , and Hou fled to Liang , seizing the Liang border city of Shouyang ( , in modern Lu'an , Anhui ) as his base of operations . Gao Cheng then began negotiating peace with Liang 's Emperor Wu , intending to create instability in the relationship between Emperor Wu and Hou . Hou , eventually coming to believe that Emperor Wu would betray him and turn him over to Eastern Wu to exchange for Xiao Yuanming , rebelled in fall 548 , eventually capturing the Liang capital Jiankang and holding Emperor Wu and then his successor Emperor Jianwen of Liang as puppets . Once Hou did so , he made an overture of peace to Gao Cheng , but Gao Cheng did not respond . Meanwhile , Gao Cheng was trying to recapture the provinces that Western Wei had taken from Hou . Also in 548 , he sent Gao Yue and Murong Shaozong to siege Changshe ( , in modern Xuchang , Henan ) , but Changshe , defended by the Western Wei general Wang Sizheng ( ) , would not fall easily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Murong Shaozong and another major general , Liu Fengsheng ( ) . In summer 549 , Gao Cheng himself commanded reinforcements and arrived at Changshe . He intensified the siege , and soon , Changshe fell , and he captured Wang , whom he treated with respect . After Changshe fell , Western Wei forces also withdrew from the three other provinces that they had captured , and Eastern Wei by this time had recaptured all of the land that Hou had initially taken . # Death # Meanwhile , Gao Cheng was beginning to confer with his associates on how he could seize the throne . In fall 549 , he was in a meeting with Chen Yuankang , Cui Jishu , and Yang Yin , discussing the procedure for doing so . One of the attending servants was Lan Jing ( ) , a son of the Liang general Lan Qin ( ) , whom he had captured in battle and had repeatedly refused to release despite both Lan Qin 's and Lan Jing 's pleas to allow Lan Qin to ransom his son .
