establishedtitle = Mato Grosso ( lit . Thick Bushes ) is one of the states of Brazil , the third largest by area , located in the western part of the country . Neighboring states are ( from west clockwise ) Rondnia , Amazonas , Par , Tocantins , Gois and Mato Grosso do Sul . It also borders Bolivia to the southwest . A state with a flat landscape , alternating great ' ' chapadas ' ' and plain areas , Mato Grosso presents three different ecosystems : Cerrado , Pantanal and the Amazon Rainforest . The vegetation of the open pasture covers 40% of the state , and the Chapada dos Guimares National Park , with its caves , grottos , tracks and waterfalls , is one of its great tourist attractions . In the north is the Amazonian forest , with a biodiversity covering half of the state . The Xingu National Park and the Araguaia River are in Mato Grosso . Further south , the Pantanal , the world 's largest wetland , is the habitat for almost a thousand species of animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mato Grosso is the Chapada dos Guimares , a unique and beautiful environment made from sandstone mountains and their subsequent erosion . The terrain of the Mato Grosso is varied and includes cliffs , canyons , and beautiful waterfalls . The biologically rich Pantanal , one of the world 's largest wetland/prairie ecosystems , is also located within this state . Much environmental degradation has occurred to the Pantanal within the past few decades , and it shows no sign of stopping anytime soon . The Pantanal can be compared to the Everglades in Florida , as both share much in common , habitat wise , although the Pantanal is of much larger scale . # History # In 1977 , the state was split into two halves , with Mato Grosso do Sul becoming a new state . The Bororo Indians live in the Mato Grosso area . As late as 1880 , soldiers patrolled lands on the outskirts of Cuiab , Mato Grosso 's capital and largest city , to protect settlers from Bororo raids . By the end of the 19th century , although severely reduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospectors , settlers , and other indigenous groups , as many as five to ten thousand Bororo continued to occupy central and eastern Mato Grosso , as well as western Gois . The southwestern part of it was ceded to Bolivia in exchange for Acre , according to Treaty of Petrpolis in 1903 . The historic remoteness of this area led it to be the subject of exploration , most notably by Captain Percy Fawcett , in the quest for lost cities . It was also the rumored location of access to the interior of the earth in various Hollow Earth theories . # Demographics # Mato Grosso had a high rate of population growth in the 20th century . Despite this , the state as a whole has one of the lowest population densities of any Brazilian state . Ethnically , the state includes a relatively high proportion of caboclos ( persons of mixed European and Indian ancestry ) , as do other areas of the interior . According to the IBGE of 2008 , 3,010,000 people resided in the state . The population density was 3.2 inh. /km . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.4% ( 19912000 ) ; Houses : 836,000 ( 2006 ) .

The Miranda , Aquidauna , Taquari and Cuiaba rivers flow into the Paraguay River . From October to April , the high waters reveal outsized lakes , bays , river branches and outlets . The Transpantaneira Highway connects the town of Pocone to Jofre Port , along the Cuiab River bank . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 149 km . On the way , it is possible to observe wild animals , especially alligators , capybaras and birds , among other wild animals . SESC 's Private Natural Heritage Reserve ( RPPN ) increases by one-third the total area of this preserved ecosystem in the State of Mato Grosso .
