It was presented by Jeremy Bowen , and its first episode premiered in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2001 . The executive producer was Ruth Pitt and it was directed by Jean-Claude Bragardit took a total of 16 months to produce and cost . A full symphonic score was composed by James Whitbourn . ' ' Son of God ' ' featured interviews with 21 historians and other Biblical experts , live action reenactments of the life of Jesus with Leron Livo in the lead role , and computer-generated images of what locations from Jesus 's time might have looked like .

The first episode , The Real Man , looked at the historical evidence for the existence of Jesus , and documented his life from his birth to his temptation . Episode two , The Mission , discussed how Jesus became popular among Jews and Greeks , and why the Pharisees of the area might have seen him as a threat . The Final Hours , the third and final episode of ' ' Son of God ' ' , looked at Jesus 's crucifixion , and presented some ideas as to how the traditional views of the crucifixion may conflict with how it really occurred . The episode concluded with the construction of a computer-generated animation of how Jesus may have appeared . Critical reaction to the series was mixed . While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality , others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents . The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK on BBC One during April 2001 , where it received a viewership of six million and an audience share of 25% . In the United States , the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name ' ' Jesus : The Complete Story ' ' as a single three-hour programme , two weeks after its UK broadcast . The show was also licensed to countries including France , Denmark and New Zealand . # Production # ' ' Son of God ' ' was devised in 1999 , and was produced and joint-sponsored by BBC Manchester and the Discovery Channel in association with France 3 and Jerusalem Productions . The show was directed by Jean-Claude Bragardwhose previous BBC work had included ' ' Kicking &amp; Screaming A History of Football ' ' and the documentary series ' ' Panorama ' ' and the executive producer was Ruth Pitt , who had worked on documentaries such as ' ' 42 Up ' ' and Channel 4 's ' ' The State of Marriage ' ' . During its promotion , Pitt described ' ' Son of God ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been done . Jeremy Bowen , a former Middle East correspondent for BBC News , was chosen to present the programme for its UK broadcast . British conductor James Whitbourn was commissioned to write a complete symphonic score for the series , which was performed by the BBC Philharmonic . The completed programme featured more than an hour and a half of Whitbourn 's music . Whitbourn subsequently used the seminal themes from his orchestral score as the basis of his popular choral work , ' ' Son of God Mass ' ' , for soprano saxophone , choir and organ . Computer graphic images were created by design group Red Vision , who employed techniques similar to ones used in the 2000 BBC series ' ' Walking with Dinosaurs ' ' . Speaking in September 2001 , a spokesman for Red Vision stated that their involvement in ' ' Son of God ' ' had been incredibly successful for them . Promotional campaigns for both the British and American broadcasts of the series focused on the technology and science being used in the programme , and the special effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facial reconstruction during the final episode showing what Jesus might have looked like garnered significant media attention . In the lead-up to episode one , several newspapers , including ' ' The Daily Mail ' ' and ' ' The Guardian ' ' , ran stories speculating whether the computer-generated image could show the true face of Jesus . British television listings magazine ' ' Radio Times ' ' featured the reconstructed face on the cover of its 31 March issue under the headline Is This the Face of Jesus ? . This cover and its headline received criticism from some commentators for being sensationalist and misleading . # Episodes # ' ' Son of God ' ' consists of a single series of three episodes . Each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of Jesus 's life . The episodes take the format of Bowen visiting significant locations from the life of Jesus , talking head interviews with 21 historians and Biblical experts , and reenactments of Jesus 's life featuring Israeli actor Liron Levo . Locations from Jesus 's timesuch as Caesarea , Yatta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , and were then digitised into computer graphics by Red Vision . # The Real Man # The first episode of ' ' Son of God ' ' , The Real Man , documents Jesus 's life up to his temptation , and details the historical evidence for his existence . Bowen visits Jerusalem , where he calls Jesus 's death one of the best attested facts in ancient history . **33;50392;ref He cites the Romano-Jewish historian Josephus as one of 80 sources that confirms that Jesus existed and that describes him as a wise man who did surprising feats , .. won over followers from among Jews and Greeks , .. was accused by the Jewish leaders , and was condemned to be crucified by Pilate . Bowen interviews James H. Charlesworth from Princeton University about the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 , then travels to Bethlehem to visit the Church of the Nativity , a structure built over a series of first-century caves and grottos . While there , he speculates that Jesus may have been born in a cave rather than an inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem confirms this , saying that the Greek word katalyma is usually translated into English as upper room rather than inn . **34;50427;ref The Real Man also looks at the story of the Star of Bethlehem , which Bowen states would have been an astrological rather than astronomical phenomenon . According to astronomer Michael Molner , astrologers from around the time of Herod the Great would have believed that the constellation Aries symbolised his kingdom and the lands that he controlled during 6 BC , the year that some scholars theorise that Jesus was born , a rare planetary alignment meant that Jupiter , Saturn , the Sun and the Moon would have all appeared in this constellation . **34;50463;ref Bowen next looks at how Jesus would have been born out of wedlock : Mark Goodacre , a historian from the University of Birmingham , asserts that Jewish , pagan and Christian sources all confirm that Jesus was born out of wedlock , as do both the Gospels of Matthew and Luke . All four canonical gospels agree that the city of Nazareth was where Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , proposes that Jesus 's interest in religion and politics might have been sparked off during a family visit to the Temple Mount , the headquarters of the Jewish faith . **34;50499;ref The episode ends with Bowen spending the night alone at the Mount of Temptation just above Jericho , where Jesus is traditionally believed to have spent 40 days and nights being tempted by the devil . # The Mission # Episode two , The Mission , discusses how Jesus became popular and why the Pharisees might have seen him as a potential threat . Bowen visits the Dome of the Rock , the site of Jerusalem 's temple , and discusses how Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee to recruit his disciples . He speaks with Orna Cohen , a conservator of antiquities who led the excavation of the Sea of Galilee Boat , who suggests that the boat may have been similar to one owned by Saint Peter . Bowen then travels to Capernaum and visits the House of Peter , where he speaks to Mordechai Aviam , an archaeologist from the Israel Antiquities Authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the house belonged to Peter . Bowen visits the tomb of a first-century scholar and miracle-worker named Hanina ben Dosa , and contrasts Hanina 's life with that of Jesus 's : for example , while Jesus was executed , Hanina was not . **32;50535;ref The Mission then looks at how Jesus may have been viewed by the religious leaders of the time . The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms , and making the unclean clean again . **33;50569;ref Jesus told lepers to go up to the Temple Mount , where they were usually excluded , and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels . Jesus met and ate with sinners , the disabled and prostitutes , and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover . Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening . **33;50604;ref # The Final Hours # The Final Hours , the third episode of ' ' Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Bowen claims that the Last Supper would have been held in the guest room of a well-to-do house in Jerusalem . **36;50639;ref Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium . As guest of honour , Jesus would have been at the end of the table with John the Apostle at his side , rather than at the centre , as proposed by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci 's ' ' The Last Supper ' ' . Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane . Leaving the Middle East for the first time , he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe , a forensic pathologist at Columbia University . Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis , a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die . He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences . Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County , Vermont , by measuring their blood pressure while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with their shoulders . He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus 's crucifixion , with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists , may have been possible if his feet were supported . The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan , a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion , also supports this theory . **37;50677;ref Next , Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus . William Klassen , an historian at cole Biblique in Jerusalem , theorises that the Greek word paradidomi was mistranslated , and that Judas simply handed over Jesus to the Romans , rather than betrayed him . **37;50716;ref The Final Hours ends with a facial reconstruction suggesting what Jesus may have looked like . Using one of three first-century Jewish skulls from a forensic science department in Israel , a clay model is created through forensic anthropology by Richard Neave , a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at Manchester University . The graphics created by Red Vision were well received : ' ' The Daily Record ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLean of ' ' The Guardian ' ' noted that the series was visually , .. quite a treat . McLean also commented that the programme itself was rather interesting , but that it contained slightly odd , slightly irrelevant diversions . A review of a more critical nature came from Catherine Bennett , also writing for ' ' The Guardian ' ' , who questioned the facial reconstruction from the third episode and suggested that it was dismissive to imply that it was how Jesus truly appeared . Speaking about the study , Bennett remarked : We must hope that .. future BBC controllers do not dig up , say , Robin Cook 's skull , drape it in Plasticine , and ask : ' Is this the real face of Tony Blair ? . John Preston , writing for ' ' The Sunday Telegraph ' ' , also questioned the reliability of the reconstruction , and branded the series as dumbed down . The programme received criticism from theological scholars : following the broadcast of the first episode , Tom Wright , one of two consultants used during production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been misrepresented by the show . Wright claimed that the BBC had elected to portray Jesus simply as a politically correct social worker . Father Heinrich Pfeiffer , a German professor of iconography at the Pontifical Gregorian University , similarly felt that the computer-generated face conflicted with the ones seen in the Shroud of Turin and the Manoppello Image . Reviews of the American broadcast of ' ' Jesus : The Complete Story ' ' were also mixed . While some reviewers described the show as fascinating and reverent , During its American broadcast on the Discovery Channel , the series was watched by 12 million . It was repeated in the US during March the following year , and gained a figure of 1.5 million viewers per episode . The series was nominated for two awards , both for the computer-generated images created by graphics team Red Vision : it was first nominated at the 2001 LEAF Awards , then won an Outstanding Achievement award at the 2001 Royal Television Society North Awards . class= wikitable plainrowheaders ! scope=colYear ! scope=colAward ! scope=colCategory ! scope=colResult ! scope=rowLEAF Award - ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of God ' ' was distributed by the BBC , who broadcast the show on BBC One .
