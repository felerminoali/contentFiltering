In music theory , a theoretical key or impossible key is a key and scale which exists in theory and practice , but whose corresponding key signature make its notation impractical . Such a key is one whose key signature would contain one or more double-flats or double-sharps . Double-flats and double-sharps are used in music as accidentals , but they are never placed in the key signature ( in music that uses equal temperament ) , due to notational convention and because reading the music would become unnecessarily difficult . For example , the key of D minor is not conventionally used in notated music , because its corresponding key signature would contain a B ( submediant ) . An equal-tempered scale of D minor comprises the same notes as the C minor scale . Under equal temperament the scales sound exactly the same ; such key pairs are said to be enharmonically equivalent . So the theoretical key of D minor is usually practically notated by a key signature of C minor . class= wikitable - The other option is to use either no key signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the B s. # Enharmonic equivalence # While a piece of Western music generally has a home key , a passage within it may modulate to another key , which is usually closely related to the home key ( in the Baroque and early Classical eras ) , that is , close to the original around the circle of fifths . When the key is near the top of the circle ( a key signature of zero or few accidentals ) , the notation of both keys is straightforward . But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle ( a key signature of many accidentals ) , and particularly if the new key is on the opposite side ( in the late Classical and Romantic eras ) , it becomes necessary to consider enharmonic equivalence . In each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents ' ' can ' ' be notated and so do not classify as ' theoretical keys ' : # The need to consider theoretical keys # But when a relative key ascends the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory suggests that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be incorporated into the notated key signature . The following six keys ( which are the parallel major/minor keys of those above ) would require one , two or three double-sharps or double-flats : For example , pieces in the major mode commonly modulate up a fifth to the dominant ; for a key with sharps in the signature this leads to a key whose key signature has an additional sharp . A piece in C which performs this modulation would lead to the theoretical key of G , requiring an eighth sharp , meaning an F in place of the F already present . In order to write that passage with a new key signature , it would become necessary to recast the new section using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A major . However , such passages are usually notated with the use of accidentals , as in this example from Bach 's Well-Tempered Clavier , in G major ( the overall key is C major ) : # Tunings other than twelve-tone equal-temperament # In a different tuning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several keys do require a double-sharp or double-flat in the key signature , and no longer have conventional equivalents : where there are 19 tones in the scale , the key of B major ( 9 flats ) is equivalent to A major ( 10 sharps ) . In 17 tone equal temperament and 31 tone equal temperament , keys that are enharmonic in a 12 tone system ( for example , C and D minor ) may have to be notated completely differently
