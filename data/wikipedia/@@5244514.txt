On June 26 , 2006 , the latter band filed a federal lawsuit against Mark Burnett Productions , Rockstar Entertainment , CBS , Tommy Lee , Jason Newsted , and Gilby Clarke . The California band sought both compensatory and punitive damages , as well as trademark protection of the Supernova name , the destruction of all Rock Star materials bearing the name Supernova , and clarifying statements made on the show .
