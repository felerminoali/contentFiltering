' ' Handsome ' ' is the debut album of the Ian Dury rock group Kilburn and the High-Roads .

In 1998 as part of their 30th Anniversary series Dawn re-issued the album onto CD in a very unconventional way , instead of adding bonus tracks to the end of the album or on a second disc , Dawn decided to re-organize the album 's track order to accommodate the missing B-sides as well as adding four previously unreleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiny Fingers one of only two cover versions Ian Dury has ever officially released , the other being Girls ( Watching ) on his 1980 album ' ' Lord Upminster ' ' . # First Mixes # In 1996 Repertoire Records released a 2-CD Ian Dury retrospective ' ' Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads : Reasons to Be Cheerful ' ' which included tracks from all of his solo albums and many of his solo singles but instead of including tracks from either ' ' Handsome ' ' or ' ' Wotabunch ! ' ' they chose to include 10 tracks recorded in 1974 which they claim are the first mixes for some of the tracks from ' ' Handsome ' ' however the version of Rough Kids is almost identical to the version on ' ' Wotabunch ! ' ' ( minus the ad-libs ) , and furthermore their time of recording suggests it is possible the tracks are in fact from the Raft recordings , regardless the ten tracks are Rough Kids , You 're More Than Fair , Billy Bentley , Pam 's Moods , Upminster Kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call-Up and the wrong titled The Mumble Rumble ( The Mumble Rumble &amp; The Cocktail Rock ) . Pam 's Moods 2 is another mix of Pam 's Moods . These tracks show little signs of the smooth , softened , high-produced versions finally released on ' ' Handsome ' ' and are far similar to the band 's live sound and are not mentioned at all in either Ian Dury autobiography and noticeably included You 're More Than Fair , which was not included on the final album . # Further reading # * ' ' Sex And Drugs And Rock And Roll : The Life Of Ian Dury ' ' by Richard Balls , first published 2000 , Omnibus Press * ' ' Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads : Song By Song ' ' by Jim Drury , first published 2003 , Sanctuary Publishing . * ' ' Reasons To Be Cheerful ' ' 2-Disc Compilation first released 1996 , Repertoire Records *Booklet to the Dawn 's 1998 re-issue of ' ' Handsome ' ' .
