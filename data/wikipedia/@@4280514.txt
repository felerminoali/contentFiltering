North Coast Rocketry was a model rocket company founded in Ohio by Chris Pearson and Matt Steele , with Dan Kafun added as a partner in 1989. # History # North Coast Rocketry ( NCR ) had their own line of unique High Power rockets and introduced some technologies and designs that were cutting edge for their time . To augment their product line , NCR was also a dealer for Class C Aerotech motors and Class B Vulcan motors in the mid to late 1980s . NCR sold a limited selection of disposable motors in 1984 that were called North Coasters . The North Coaster motors were manufactured by Aerotech under a special agreement with NCR , who had sole distribution rights . The motors were shipped to North Coast Rocketry near Cleveland , Ohio , with no end caps or labels , and final processing was conducted by North Coast Rocketry . The North Coasters motor line consisted of the E28 ( 24mm ) , F41 ( 24mm ) and G60 ( 29mm ) motors . They were phased out late in 1987 due to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few prototype cases were made , but the propellant shipping issues of the early 1990s stopped their development . NCR reloadable motor design was said to be so simple , using color-coded parts , that assembly could be done by someone who knew nothing about rockets and who had n't read one word of the instructions . The reloadable motor technology was never actually put into production . North Coast Rocketry was moved to Colorado and Utah in the early 1990s . During this time , NCR branched out into making composite motors based on potassium perchlorate that would produce a pink flame during the burn . North Coast Rocketry was subsequently purchased by Estes Industries ' around 1995-1996 and served as Estes ' mid/high power model rocketry division . The NCR motor technology was changed by Estes to the more industry-standard **26;37903;TOOLONG composite propellant . All Estes versions of the NCR models used DarkStar motors , which emitted a dark black smoke trail . These motors were made specifically for NCR rockets and were slightly smaller in diameter than their competitor 's motors . The motor was unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor . Estes discontinued the NCR line of rockets and other products in 2000 . Since the brand has been discontinued , most people modify the motor mounts to use industry-standard 29 mm size motors . NCR also sold a heavy duty launch pad and controller for their rockets . At NARAM-53 ( the National Association of Rocketry 's Annual Meet ) in Cincinnati in July 2011 , Matt Steele ( one of the principals of the former North Coast Rocketry ) announced that he had sufficient rights to the name and products and that he and his daughter would be bringing the company back to life with a website going live on October 1 , 2011 . He said the initial kits would be based on 2.6 tubing , and would not be three fins and a nose cone . # Models # # Early models # * Aires XL * Avatar * Avatar Arrow * Big Brute * Black Hole Betty * Brighthawk * Corporal * D Region Tomahawk * Eliminator * Hobgoblin * Juno 1 * Kickstart Piston * Korona * Lance Beta * Magna * Mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Outlaw ( Radio Controlled Boost Glider ) * Patriot * Patriot Ready to Fly Kit * Phantom 4000 * Phantom 4000HD * Quasar NG * Rotaroc A * Rotaroc B/C * Rotaroc D * SA-14 Archer XL * Stiletto A * Stiletto B * Viking # Estes era # * Big Brute * Bomarc * Eliminator * Interceptor G * Lance Beta * Patriot * Phantom 4000 * SA-14 Archer XL * Star Wars X-Wing Fighter
