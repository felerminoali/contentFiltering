numepisodes = 26 ( includes 7 specials ) The cast of the television series ' ' MythBusters ' ' perform experiments to verify or debunk urban legends , old wives ' tales , and the like . This is a list of the various myths tested on the show , as well as the results of the experiments ( the myth is Busted , Plausible , or Confirmed ) . # Episode overview #   # Episode SP2 Buster Special # * Original airdate : February 2 , 2005 In this episode , Adam and Jamie relived Buster 's finest moments , from his introduction in ' ' Exploding Toilet ' ' to his ultimate demise ( supposedly in ' ' Ming Dynasty Astronaut ' ' ) , and showed the construction of the new Buster 2.0 . These moments include : * ' ' Exploding Toilet ' ' * ' ' Barrel of Bricks ' ' * ' ' Hammer Bridge Drop ' ' * ' ' Raccoon Rocket ' ' * ' ' The Mad Trombonist ' ' * ' ' Forest Fire Scuba Diver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ' ' Boom-Lift Catapult ' ' * ' ' Plywood Builder ' ' * ' ' Ming Dynasty Astronaut ' ' # Episode SP3 Ultimate MythBusters # * Original airdate : February 9 , 2005 In this episode , Adam and Jamie competed in a series of arguably ludicrous tests and competitions to determine which of the two was the Ultimate MythBuster . These competitions tested their ingenuity , constitution , and courage to see just how far they were willing to go to claim the title of Ultimate MythBuster . # Episode 25 Brown Note # * Original airdate : February 16 , 2005 # Blown Away # Someone who is shot and thrown backward a significant distance is a staple Hollywood visual effect . * Revisited in ' ' MythBusters Revisited ' ' # Brown Note # # Chinese Water Torture # # Episode 26 Salsa Escape # * Original airdate : February 23 , 2005 # Salsa Escape # # Cement Mix-Up # Initially the team only intended to test the scenario of explosives being used to clean a relatively thin layer of concrete from the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck was being collected , however , it was filled almost to the top with concrete , rather than just with the thin layer that the team wanted . Adam therefore suggested splitting this myth into two sub-myths , the original one of cleaning a thin layer out of a truck ( for which the team had to obtain a second truck ) , and another one involving a driver using explosives in what would presumably be a desperate attempt to remove a massive , solidified slab of concrete from the truck . # Episode 27 Exploding Port-a-Potty # * Original airdate : March 2 , 2005 # Exploding Port-a-Potty # See also ' ' Exploding Toilet ' ' . # Driveshaft Pole Vault # # Episode 28 Is Yawning Contagious ? # * Original airdate : March 9 , 2005 This was the final episode in which the Build Team worked from their M6 workshop . # Toy Car Race # # Is Yawning Contagious ? # # Toast Butter Side Up or Down ? # # Episode SP4 MythBusters Outtakes # * Original airdate : March 16 , 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown , which included some failed experiments or extra experiments that had to be trimmed out of the show for time and relevancy reasons . Clips edited out of shows previously aired include : * Breakstep Bridge revisit , the short revisit of the original myth . The revisit originally aired on Myths Revisited , but was cut from the US version . * Ping-Pong Salvage , in which a sea otter managed to interfere with the experiment by stealing a ping-pong ball from the ' ' Mythtanic II ' ' . * Plywood Builder , where Jamie had trouble with working with the zip line and Christine flat out refused to do the zip line . * Chinese Water Torture , where Tory and Scottie each had a turn on the torture rackScottie with a blindfold and head restraint , and Tory with a head restraint , shackles , and a stream of iced water . In the aired version of this myth , Kari and Adam go ' under the drip ' , and it is found that Chinese water torture is extremely effectiveAdam completes his turn without incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Kari , who was restrained , requested that her turn be cut short when she began to suffer an emotional breakdown . * Buried Alive , where Adam and a producer each tried the experiment , neither was able to match Jamie 's time in the coffin . * Cement Mix-Up , where Tory tried to remove concrete from ' ' Twister I ' ' with a jackhammer , and only barely filled the bottom of the bucket after an hour of work . * Needle in a Haystack , where Adam , before settling on the ' ' Needlefinder 2000 ' ' , considered using a sieve , a metal detector , and a bloodhound to find the needles . * Escape From Alcatraz , where Adam and Jamie explored the idea that the escape raft washed ashore on Angel Island after making it to the Marin Headlands as a way to throw the FBI off the convicts ' trail . Using a scale model of the San Francisco Bay area , the tide could have washed the raft onto Angel Island if released from the Marin Headlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no concrete evidence existed to prove or disprove the theory . * Carried Away , in which the Build Team used a pressure chamber to determine the height above sea level at which party balloons would pop . The balloons burst at an altitude between 23000and25000 ft. * Eelskin Wallet , in which Adam and Jamie tested neodymium magnets to see whether they had the desired effect . The data were successfully erased in just one swipe . This segment was left out due to them not being able to properly assess the power of the magnets . The magnetometer used in testing the strengths of the other items ceased functioning when a neodymium magnet was held near it . * Bug Bomb , in which Adam and Jamie tested whether sawdust , flour , straw , or fake smoke could have also caused an explosion if a spark was nearby . None of the materials tested could fully ignite , though sawdust and flour did burn slightly , and reports of flour and saw mill explosions have been confirmed . * Elevator of Death , in which the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator move faster , whether someone can be decapitated by a closing elevator door , and whether zero gravity can be attained by jumping in an elevator . All three questions were answered in the negative . Six of the deleted segments , titled as the Lost Experiments , are available on the Discovery Channel website . Original myths that were completely edited out include : # Episode 29 Cooling a Six-Pack # * Original airdate : March 23 , 2005 From this episode , the Build Team operates from their new M7 workshop . Also featured in this episode is the first test of Buster 2.0 , built during the Buster special , as well as the final test of Earl the MythBusters Caddy , which was dropped from a crane to fulfil a promise to its previous owner that it would be destroyed on the show . While preparing Earl to be dropped from the crane , Scottie encountered a problem in that the rear windows needed to be opened to loop a chain through the passenger compartment , but the mechanism was jammed . She therefore took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Six pack # * With this myth quickly busted , Adam and Jamie each tried to build devices which could rapidly cool a six-pack , but neither device was effective enough . A carbon dioxide fire extinguisher , however , was able to cool a six-pack to a satisfactory temperature in about three minutes . In terms of practicality , though , one 's best bet is to use icy salt water , which cooled the beer to an ideal temperature in 5 minutes . Barring that , normal ice water was next fastest at 15 minutes . The other methods tested ( the freezer , ice only , and the refrigerator ) did not cool the beer rapidly enough to warrant their use in a spur-of-the-moment event .  Reference :  # Baghdad Battery # The Build Team created several copies of the Baghdad battery , an archaeological find which seems to suggest that ancient Babylonians were the first to use batteries .

It featured insights from and interviews with Adam , Jamie , Kari , Tory and producer Peter Rees , about various aspects of Mythbusters , as well as explored personal issues between the hosts . # Episode SP7 Hollywood on Trial # * Original airdate : May 11 , 2005 The MythBusters test some of the pervasive myths that are created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Hollywood-inspired myths . This special also marks the debut of Grant Imahara as the third member of the Build Team , though the next two regular episodes ( Breaking Glass and Jet Pack ) did show Scottie Chapman in that capacity instead . # Episode 31 Breaking Glass # * Original airdate : May 18 , 2005 # Breaking Glass # Adam and Jamie investigate whether a human voice could shatter glass , as perpetuated in stories of opera singers and demonstrated by Ella Fitzgerald in a commercial for Memorex and Jim Gillette in the music video for Nitro 's Freight Train . # Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss # The Build Team takes on another old adage , and sees if it remains relevant in modern use .

This is also the first ' ' MythBusters ' ' special to run for two hours rather than one . More recent reruns have tended to show a version edited down to one hour . The episode was also referred to as the Shark Special in the ' ' 22,000 Foot Fall ' ' episode .
