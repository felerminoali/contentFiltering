The General Certificate of Education Advanced Level generally termed the GCE Advanced Level or , more commonly , the A Level is a school leaving qualification offered by educational bodies in the United Kingdom and the British Crown dependencies to students completing secondary or pre-university education . A number of countries , including Singapore and Mauritius have developed qualifications with the same name as and a similar format to the British A Levels . The qualification is generally studied for over two years and split into two parts , with one part studied in each year . The first part is known as the Advanced Subsidiary Level , or AS Level , and was previously known as the Advanced Supplementary Level , with the same abbreviation . The second part is known as the A2 Level . The AS Level is a qualification in its own right , and the AS Level combined with the A2 Level forms the complete A Level qualification . # Current usage # A number of countries use the A Levels as a school leaving qualification .

In Scotland , A Levels are also offered by select schools as an alternative school-leaving qualification in place of the Scottish Advanced Higher . The five main examination boards which administer British A Levels in the UK are : * Assessment and Qualifications Alliance ( AQA ) * Edexcel * Oxford , Cambridge and RSA Examinations ( OCR ) * Welsh Joint Education Committee ( WJEC ) * Council for the Curriculum , Examinations &amp; Assessment ( CCEA ) Edexcel and Cambridge International Examinations ( CIE ) also offer international versions of the British A Levels in the United Kingdom and worldwide .

However , some universities also require applicants to take separate entrance examinations and the International Baccalaureate and European Baccalaureate are also accepted . # Hong Kong # In Hong Kong , the British A Level was once accused of grade inflation many years ago , and thus over time both the GCE A Level ( GCEAL ) and HKAL have become more strictly graded , as shown by NARIC research . Compared to the usual 2530% rate of achieving an A-grade in the UK AS/A2 , there could be statistically fewer than 0.05% candidates scoring an A in a single examination in the Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination and less than 1% rate of achieving an A-grade every year in an A Level subject . However , this comparison is seen by many as being meaningless and misleading because in the first place , grade A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second best grade in the GCE A Level to the top grade in HKAL is not very useful and objective . Moreover , it is important to note that because of the significantly different measurement methodologies , these examinations are not directly comparable in terms of the skills and knowledge demonstrated at each grade and that distinction rates alone can not serve as a fair indicator of one 's absolute academic performance . In that NARIC research , only the cumulative percentages were taken into account to reach the huge generalisations , on the very unsafe assumption that two scales are exactly identical and standardised . The wide recognition for both qualifications in many local universities and companies all attests to this . For example , many prestigious overseas universities regard the HK qualifications ( HKCEE and HKALE ) as being equivalent to the UK ones ( IGCSE and GCEAL ) on a grade-by-grade basis
