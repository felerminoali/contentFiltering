Lieutenant General Sir James Moncrieff Grierson KCB , CMG , CVO , ADC ( 27 January 1859 17 August 1914 ) was a British soldier . # Military career # Grierson was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1877 . He served in the Egyptian War including the actions at Kassassin and Tel el Kebir , as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General with the Indian contingent in 1882 . He was Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General for the Sudan expedition and was involved in actions at Suakin , Hasheen and Tamai in 1885 . He was Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General for 2nd Brigade during the Hazara expedition in 1888 . He was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General , Intelligence , at Army Headquarters in 1890 and then became Brigade Major for the Royal Artillery at Aldershot from 1895 to 1896 when he became Military Attach in Berlin acquiring what Sir John French later described as an intimate knowledge of the German army . He served in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 , and later the same year in the Second Boer War in South Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 2nd Army Corps and Chief Staff Officer to Sir Evelyn Wood , commanding the corps ; and was promoted to the substantive rank of Colonel in October 1901 . In early 1902 he was ordered for temporary duty in the Remount Department . He was appointed Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters in 1904 , General Officer Commanding , 1st Division at Aldershot Command in 1906 and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for Eastern Command in 1912 . In the Army Manoeuvres of 1912 , he made full use of aircraft reconnaissance to decisively beat Douglas Haig , despite Haig having the odds in his favour . In the Army Manoeuvres of 1913 , Grierson acted as Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) for Sir John French . Douglas Haig noted in his diary , Sir John French 's instructions for moving along the front of his enemy ( then halted on a fortified position ) and subsequently attacking the latter 's distant flank , were of such an unpractical nature that his Chief of the General Staff demurred . Some slight modifications in the orders were permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was very soon transferred to another appointment in the BEF . French himself described Grierson as a dear old friend and comrade , .. who astonished French soldiers by his knowledge of the history of their regiments and whose military acquirements were brilliant and in every respect up to date . Grierson was very overweight , and used to go red in the face from bending over , due to high blood pressure , and Edmonds later claimed that his staff were issued with penknives to bleed him if necessary . He died of an aneurism of the heart on a train , near Amiens at 7:00 a.m. on 17 August 1914 . His replacement as commander of II Corps was Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien . Grierson spoke French fluently and was a personal friend of Haig , the commander of I Corps , so it is possible that relations over the next few days , both between the two British corps and with the French , might have been better had he lived . Grierson 's body was repatriated , a practice allowed at that time , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , father and mother . These were full interments . The Sir James Moncrieff Grierson prize for languages was later established at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst . # Medals and Orders # British decorations * Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) - ' ' 1902 ' ' * Royal Victorian Order , Commander ( CVO ) - ' ' 1904 ' ' ( Member MVO 1890s ) * Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath ( KCB ) , ' ' 1911 ' ' ( Companion ( CB ) ' ' 29 November 1900 ' ' , in recognition of the services during operations in China ) * Knight of Grace , Order of St. John of Jerusalem * Egyptian Medal , 1882 , clasps for Tel el Kebir and Suakin 1885 * North-West Frontier Medal , clasp for Hazara 1888 * Jubilee Medal , 1897 * South African War Medal , clasps for Cape Colony , Driefontein , Johannesburg , and Diamond Hill * China War Medal * Coronation Medal , 1902 * Coronation Medal , 1911 * Aide de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Order of the Medjidie , Ottoman Empire * Khedive 's Star , Khedivate of Egypt - ' ' 1882 ' ' * 1st Class , Order of the Crown , Kingdom of Prussia - ' ' 1901 ' ' - on the termination of his appointment as Military Attach at Berlin ( he had previously received the 2nd class of the same order ) * Albert Order Medal , Kingdom of Saxony - ' ' 1911 ' ' * Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Siam , Kingdom of Thailand - ' ' 1911 ' ' * King Rama VI 's Coronation Medal , Kingdom of Thailand - ' ' 1911 ' ' # Publications by Grierson # * ' ' Notes on the Turkish Army ' ' Simla 1882 ( compiled for the Intelligence Branch , India ) * ' ' A Vocabulary of the Arabic Language ' ' Roorkee 1882 * ' ' The War in Turkomania : Skobeleff 's Campaign of 1880-81 ' ' Translated from the Russian of Major-General N.
