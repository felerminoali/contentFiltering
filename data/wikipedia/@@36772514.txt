Lady Carla ( foaled 8 March 1993 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the Epsom Oaks in 1996 . In a racing career which lasted from October 1995 to July 1997 the filly ran six times and won three races . After winning her only race as a two-year-old , Lady Carly won the Listed Oaks Trial Stakes at Lingfield Park on her three-year-old debut . Four weeks later she maintained her unbeaten run in the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom , winning by nine lengths . She was beaten when favourite for the Irish Oaks and finished unplaced in two races the following season before being retired to stud. # Background # Lady Carla was a bay mare with a white star , bred by the Meon Valley Stud in Hampshire , England .

As a descendant of the French broodmare Democratie , she was related to the Oaks winners Juliette Marny and Scintillate as well as the St Leger winner Julio Mariner , the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Matatina and the Middle Park Stakes winner Showdown . As a yearling , Lady Carla was sent to the Tattersalls September sales at Newmarket , where she was bought for 220,000 guineas by Wafic Said 's Addison Racing Ltd . Lady Carla was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket . She was ridden to all her wins by the veteran Irish jockey Pat Eddery. # Racing career # Lady Carla did not appear on a racecourse in 1995 until late October , when she was sent to contest a 4,000 maiden race at Leicester Racecourse . She started the 5/2 second favourite in a field of twelve runners and won by four lengths from the colt General Macarthur .

She started 4/11 favourite against three opponents and led from the start to win by three and a half lengths from Flame Valley and Moody 's Cat . The field for the 1996 Epsom Oaks was not a strong one , with the Rockfel Stakes winner Bint Salsabil being the only one of the eleven fillies to have won at Group race level . The best filly of the season , Bosra Sham ( also owned by Said and trained by Cecil ) , was rested during the summer after winning the 1000 Guineas . Lady Carla was made 100/30 second favourite behind Pricket , the representative of Sheikh Mohammed 's Godolphin organisation . Pricket had been trained by Henry Cecil before until Sheikh Mohammed had withdrawn all his horses from the Warren Place stable the previous autumn .

Two furlongs from the finish , Lady Carla took the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths from Pricket , with Mezzogiorno half a length back in third . The winning distance was the fourth longest of the century , after those of Sun Princess ( twelve lengths in 1983 ) , Noblesse ( ten lengths in 1963 ) and Jet Ski Lady ( ten lengths in 1991 ) . Only five fillies appeared to oppose Lady Carla in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh in July , and she started at odds of 1/2 to maintain her unbeaten record . The build-up to the race was marked by controversy , with Cecil angrily denying claims from the television pundit John McCririck that the filly had developed a serious respiratory condition . In the race , Eddery attempted to lead from the start , but when Lady Carla was challenged in the straight she failed to respond and was soon beaten . She finished fourth behind the Dermot Weld-trained Dance Design , beaten by four and a half lengths .
