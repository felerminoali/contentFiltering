Wild silks have been known and used in many countries from early times , although the scale of production is far smaller than that from cultivated silkworms. # Background # Wild silk should not be confused with the very rare sea silk , which is produced from the fibres or byssus produced by the seashell ' ' Pinna nobilis ' ' and related species . Commercially reared silkworms of the species ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) are normally killed before the pupae emerge , either by pricking them with a needle or dipping the cocoons into boiling water , thus allowing the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread . This allows a much finer cloth to be woven from the silk . There are more than 500 species of wild silkworms in the world , although only a few are used to produce cloth . They usually produce a tougher and rougher silk than that from domesticated ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' silkworms . Wild silks are usually harvested after the moths have left the cocoons , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one long thread , as with domesticated silkworms . Wild silks are more difficult to bleach and dye than silk from ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' , but most have naturally attractive colours , particularly the rich golden sheen of the silk produced by the muga silkworm from Assam . often known as Assam silk . The cocoon shells of wild silk moths are toughened or stabilized either by tanning ( cross-linking ) or by mineral reinforcements ( e.g. calcium oxalate ) . Recently , a new method has been developed , demineralizing , which can remove the mineral reinforcements present in wild silks and enables wet reeling like the commercial silkworm ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' . # Wild silk industry in India # Wild silks are often referred to in India as ' Vanya ' silks : # The term ' Vanya ' is of Sanskrit origin , meaning untamed , wild , or forest-based . Muga , Tasar , and Eri silkworms are not fully tamed and the world lovingly calls the silks they produce as ' wild silks ' . # #  India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muga and eri . The silkworm ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' is fed on mulberry leaves cultivated in plantations . Silkworms are also found wild on forest trees , e.g ' ' Antheraea paphia ' ' which produces the tasar silk ( Tussah ) . ' ' Antheraea paphia ' ' feeds on several trees such as ' ' Anogeissus latifolia ' ' , ' ' Terminalia tomentosa ' ' , ' ' T. arjuna ' ' ( ' ' Terminalia arjuna ' ' ) , ' ' Lagerstroemia parviflora ' ' and ' ' Madhuca indica ' ' . Wild silkworm ' ' Antheraea assamensis ' ' produces muga silk , and another wild silkworm ' ' Philosamia synthia ricini ' ' ( = ' ' Samia cynthia ' ' ) produces eri silk . The estimated annual production of tasar silk is 130 tonnes . Production of other types of silk exceeds 10 000 tonnes ( Gupta 1994 ) .  # The eri silk worm from India feeds on the leaves of the castor plant . It is the only completely domesticated silkworm other than ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but can not be easily reeled off the cocoon and is thus spun like cotton or wool . # Wild silk industry in China # Some of the best quality wild silk is produced by silkworms from Honan , which is the only type of wild silk that can be easily dyed . # History # Wild silk threads have been found and identified from two Indus River sites , Harappa and Chanhu-daro , dating to c. 2450-2000 BCE . This is roughly the same period as the earliest evidence of silk use in China , which is generally thought to have had the oldest silk industry in the world . The specimens of threads from Harappa appear on Scanning electron microscope analysis to be from two different species of silk moth , ' ' Antheraea mylitta ' ' and ' ' A. assamensis ' ' , while the silk from Chanhu-daro may be from a ' ' Philosamia ' ' species , ( Eri silk ) , and this silk appears to have been reeled . Wild silks were in use in China from early times . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire and apparently imported goods made from them by the time of the Later Han Dynasty in the 1st to 3rd centuries CE . There are significant indications in the literature that wild silks were in use in Persia and in Greece by the late 5th century BCE , apparently referred to as Amorgina or Amorgian garments in Greece . Pliny the Elder , in the 1st century CE , obviously had some knowledge of how wild silkworms ' cocoons were produced and utilised on the island of Kos for ' ' Coa vestis ' ' , even though his account included some fanciful ideas . # List of some wild silk moths and their silk # * ' ' Antheraea assamensis ' ' ( Helfer , 1837 ) . - From Assam . Its silk has a beautiful glossy golden hue which improves with age and washing . Is never bleached or dyed and is stain resistant . Was reserved for the exclusive use of royal families in Assam for 600 years . * ' ' Antheraea mylitta ' ' ( Drury , 1773 ) . - The tasar silkworm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1855 ) . - the Chinese Tussah Moth . The colour and quality of the silk depends on the climate and soil . * ' ' Antheraea polyphemus ' ' . - Has the most potential of any North American silkworms. * ' ' Antheraea yamamai ' ' ( Gunerin-Mneville , 1861 ) . - The tensan silk moth . Has been cultivated in Japan for more than 1000 years . It produces a naturally white silk but does not dye well , though it is very strong and elastic . It is now very rare and expensive . * ' ' Anisota senatoria ' ' ( J. E. Smith , 1797 ) . - Orange-tipped oakworm moth . North American moth . * ' ' Automeris io ' ' . - ( Fabricius , 1775 ) . North American moth . * ' ' Bombyx mandarina ' ' ( Moore ) . Possible wild form of ' ' B. mori ' ' . * ' ' Bombyx sinensis ' ' - from China . Prolific but small cocoons. * ' ' Callosamia promethea ' ' . - North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the Kalahari region . * ' ' Gonometa rufobrunnae ' ' Aurivillius. - Feeds on the Mopane tree in southern Africa * ' ' Hyalophora cecropia ' ' . - North American . Quality of the silk depends on food source . * ' ' Samia cynthia ' ' ( Drury , 1773 ) . - The Ailanthus Silkmoth - A somewhat domesticated silkworm from China . Introduced into North America . The eri silkmoth from Assam is a subspecies of this moth ( ' ' S. cynthia ricini ' ' ) . It produces a white silk which resembles wool mixed with cotton , but feels like silk . # Footnotes #
