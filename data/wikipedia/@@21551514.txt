' ' Poem of the Sufi Way ' ' , or ' ' Nazm al-suluk ' ' , is a poem by the Sufi mystic and scholar , Shayk Umar ibn al-Farid . An exact date of the poem 's writing is unknown as Umar ibn al-Farid ( 1181-1235ad ) is said to have written this text during the course of many years . Widely remarked as Umar ibn al-Farid 's most famous work , the poem itself is one of the longest pieces of Sufi literature to date , and is still held in high regard by modern Sufi practitioners . It is 760 verses long . It is often referred to as al-Ta'iyya al-kubra ( the Greater Poem Rhyming in T ) to differentiate it from a shorter ode that also rhymes in t . The title can also be translated to the Poem of Progress . # Origins # The origins of this work are shrouded in mythology . Most accounts of the poem 's construction derive from Shayk ibn al-Farid 's grandson , Ali sibt Ibn al-Farid in his biographical work ' ' Adorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heralding his grandfather 's legacy and many of the stories surrounding it . According to Ali , Umar ibn al-Farid would fall into deathlike trances for days , then recover and spontaneously recite verses directly inspired by God ; these verses were then collected to form this long ode . In another story related by Ali , it is said that Umar received instruction from the prophet Muhammed himself , requesting that he title it as the Poem of the Sufi Way , instead of the original title intended by Umar ibn al-Farid , The Diaries of Hearts and the Gardens ' Sweet Scents . # Content # The poem itself is designed to demonstrate a pluralistic and mystical connection to God , or Allah . Initially , the poem likens the pursuit of God 's love to the pursuit of a female , written from the man 's perspective . The narrator becomes increasingly humbled throughout the poem , and , after much desperation and awe , the link to the narrator 's lover , or God , becomes obscured to the point of total cohesion . This felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristically Sufi , yet it is also an area of critique from Muslim orthodoxies who label such possibility of equality with God as heresy . # Translation # The translation of the poem is known for its difficulty . There are many puns based on variations of the three-consonant radical of most Arabic words , as was custom to the mannerist ( badi'a ) poetry of the time . # Thematic material # As expected from a poem of such length , the Poem of the Sufi Way covers many different themes and draws on many different backgrounds . As Michael Sells writes in the Preface to Umar Ibn al-Farid : Sufi Verse , Saintly Life : ' ' The poem of the Sufi Way is a microcosm of Islamic tradition at the time of Ibn al-Farid . A preliminary list of central themes of the poem would include the following : the famous lovers of classical Arabic poetry ; key themes and passages from the Qur'an and from the hadith , the stories of the Qur'anic prophets ; the stories of the four rightly guided Caliphs ; mystical interpretations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the pre-eternal covenant ; worlds of esoteric science ( alchemy , astrology , divination , numerology ) ; the psychology of Sufi states of altered consciousness ; the stations of Muhammad 's mi'raj , or the mystic in his or her journey to the divine beloved ; and interpretations of key mystical concepts such as fana ' --the passing-away of the human self in mystical union with the divine . ' ' # Commentaries # Its importance has merited many commentaries , including ones by including al-Farghn ( d. 1300 ) , al-Qshn ( d. 1334 ) , al-Qaysar ( d. 1350 ) , Jm ( d. 1492 ) , al-Brn ( d. 1615 ) , and al-Nbulus ( d. 1730 ) . Once an unknown religious scholar asked the Shaykh 's permission to write a commentary on the Poem of the Sufi Way . Ibn al-Farid asked how long the commentary would be . When the scholar replied that it would fill two volumes , Ibn al-Farid replied that he could compose a two-volume commentary on each verse . # Notes #
